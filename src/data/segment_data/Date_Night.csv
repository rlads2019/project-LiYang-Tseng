58,58,          Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.

176,176,"          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then"

184,184,          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of

186,186,"          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to"
187,187,          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and
188,188,          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.

291,291,          (not looking at him)
292,292,          Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed
293,293,          animal metaphors that you don't
294,294,          understand. Banana Ollie?

297,297,          So I should probably get going. With the

302,302,          Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
303,303,"          off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly"
304,304,          kisses Phil on the cheek.

309,309,"          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1i<U+00BF><U+00BD>1"
310,310,"          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,"
311,311,          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
312,312,          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her
313,313,"          head, she tosses the carton in the trash."

315,315, FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
316,316,          As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
317,317,"          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks"
318,318,          a newspaper off his lawn.
319,319,          CHAZ (O.S.)
320,320,"          Well, well! We're up bright and early,"

322,322,                         PHIL
323,323,          Yes we are!
324,324,          (under his breath)
325,325,          ike you say to me every morning.
326,326,"          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and"
327,327,"          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'"
328,328,          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
329,329,"          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING"
330,330,          STUCK halfway.
331,331,

337,337,          OW! OW! OW!
338,338,"          Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and"
339,339,          peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.
340,340,"          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger"
341,341,          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
342,342,"          front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear"
343,343,          and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's
344,344,          seat.
345,345,          HONKING.

347,347, EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER
348,348,          The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD
349,349,          CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of
350,350,"          it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his"
351,351,"          window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in"
352,352,          slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR
353,353,          DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR
354,354,"          HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his"

363,363,          His name's Juan and he's some kind of
364,364,"          Spanish, I think. He knows all these"
365,365,"          exclusive, underground places downtown."
366,366,          It's so exciting. And in bed...

368,368,          I never knew I could still get my leg
369,369,          back that far.
370,370,                         CLARA
371,371,"          Too much information, Jane."

373,373, OPEN HOUSE
374,374,          Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each
375,375,"          move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,"
376,376,          cleaning and inspecting.
377,377,          The divorce was the best thing that ever
378,378,          happened to me. Seriously. You know
379,379,          that great nervous feeling in your
380,380,          stomach? Where you don't know what's
381,381,          going to happen next?

387,387,"          On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on"
388,388,          the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out
389,389,          a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a
390,390,"          SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she"
391,391,          passes.
392,392,          JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
393,393,"          With Larry, I lost that. Everything had"
394,394,"          just become routine, you know? Boring."
395,395,          Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through
396,396,"          the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a"
397,397,"          weird, loud buzzing noise."
398,398,                         JANE (CONT'D)

416,416,          (focusing on stapling)
417,417,"          Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have"
418,418,          those that much anymore.
