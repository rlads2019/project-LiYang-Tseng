"1149",1149,"Algren notes some of the Japanese soldiers are literally shaking in fear."
"1150",1150,"Algren peers again into the fog. Nothing. But the sound is closer."
"1151",1151,"Then the sound abruptly stops."
"1152",1152,"Silence broken only by the murmured prayers of some of the soldiers."

"1160",1160,"One of the Japanese soldiers faints from sheer tension."
"1161",1161,"Algren can see nothing through the dense fog. The tension is unbearable."
"1162",1162,"Then a form on horseback... ghostly... like lame sort of medieval"
"1163",1163,"monster. An elaborate, horned helmet. Sweeping samurai armor."
"1164",1164,"All we can see it the eerie silhouette in the fog."
"1165",1165,"Like something from a nightmare."
"1166",1166,"And then another figure... and another ... as 500 mounted samurai warriors"

"1195",1195,"Those soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly"

"1204",1204,"They are surrounded."
"1205",1205,"Algren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline"
"1206",1206,"soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself--"
"1207",1207,"The battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by"
"1208",1208,"lances, run down and trampled by horses."
"1209",1209,"Each samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle"
"1210",1210,"flags sweep through the fog."
"1211",1211,"Gant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of"
"1212",1212,"ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester"
"1213",1213,"repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing--"
"1214",1214,"Algren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when"
"1215",1215,"the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry"
"1216",1216,"the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past --"
"1217",1217,"But one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course"
"1218",1218,"and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground."
"1219",1219,"Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another"
"1220",1220,"rider heads toward him carrying a lance."
"1221",1221,"Algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the"
"1222",1222,"lance from his grip and running him through."
"1223",1223,"In the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting"
"1224",1224,"on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK."
"1225",1225,"The MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight."
"1226",1226,"Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He"
"1227",1227,"spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in"
"1228",1228,"half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down."
"1229",1229,"The Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing."
"1230",1230,"He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after"
"1231",1231,"Those around him have fled."
"1232",1232,"Then a blaze of bright yellow - a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing"
"1233",1233,"arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding."
"1234",1234,"We will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai."
"1235",1235,"Yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow - the speed is breathtaking - Two arrows"
"1236",1236,"slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground."
"1237",1237,"The battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight"
"1238",1238,"are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey."
"1239",1239,"Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru - samurai foot"
"1240",1240,"soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other"
"1241",1241,"                                                                                                         "
"1242",1242,"samurai wielding katana - the lethal long sword."
"1243",1243,"But rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one"
"1244",1244,"samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance."
"1245",1245,"In agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried"
"1246",1246,"deep in his chest, and fights on."
"1247",1247,"He manages to parry a blow - which SLICES into his side. The next blow"
"1248",1248,"takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes."
"1249",1249,"Algren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against"
"1250",1250,"certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren"
"1251",1251,"whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still"
"1252",1252,"dangling from the end."
"1253",1253,"The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN,"
"1254",1254,"whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His"
"1255",1255,"eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger"
"1256",1256,"holding the dogs at bay."
"1257",1257,"In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing"
"1258",1258,"BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his"
"1259",1259,"katana."
"1260",1260,"Algren seems spent - he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing"
"1261",1261,"consciousness."
"1262",1262,"                                                                      ."
"1263",1263,"But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren"
"1264",1264,"suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his"
"1265",1265,"attacker."
"1266",1266,"As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off."
"1267",1267,"A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks."
"1268",1268,"The Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially"
"1269",1269,"so that be might pass by without being jostled.                    ."
"1270",1270,"He looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet."
"1271",1271,"And we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an"
"1272",1272,"imposing man of about Algren's years."
"1273",1273,"Sensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto."
"1274",1274,"With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard."
"1275",1275,"Algren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO."
"1276",1276,"Katsumoto looks down at Algren."
"1277",1277,"Then Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his"
"1278",1278,"rifle, urgently trying to save Algren--"
"1279",1279,"Ujio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to"
"1280",1280,"protect his Lord. His sword flashes--"
"1281",1281,"                                                                                                      "
"1282",1282,"Gant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror."
"1283",1283,"A dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he"
"1284",1284,"sinks to his knees."
"1285",1285,"Katsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off."
"1286",1286,"Algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant,"
"1287",1287,"blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder."
"1288",1288,"Gant is dead."
"1289",1289,"Algren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled."
"1290",1290,"Or are surrendering, injured or dead."
"1291",1291,"And he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse,"
"1292",1292,"head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt."
"1293",1293,"Katsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems"
"1294",1294,"to agree to something."
"1295",1295,"Both men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who"
"1296",1296,"holds it out firmly."
"1297",1297,"General Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging"
"1298",1298,"it into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto."
"1299",1299,"It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide."
"1300",1300,"Algren watches, stunned."
"1301",1301,"Then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield."
"1302",1302,"Algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial"
"1303",1303,"soldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke."
"1304",1304,"Algren looks over the slaughter."
"1305",1305,"And then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him."
"1306",1306,"Fade to..."
"1307",1307,"EXT.                    MOUNTAIN PASS                               DAY"
"1308",1308,"Algren is unconscious, tied to a horse."
"1309",1309,"The mounted samurai move up a treacherous mountain pass, disappearing"
"1310",1310,"into the soaring mountains of Yoshino."
"1311",1311,"EXT.              VILLAGE                                    SUNSET"
"1312",1312,"Katsumoto's village is the other Japan. The Japan we have not yet seen."
"1313",1313,"The gorgeous mountain scenery of Yoshino envelopes the village. Snow-"
"1314",1314,"capped mountains soar in the distance. A valley below with rice fields."
"1315",1315,"                                                                                    "
"1316",1316,"After the turmoil of Tokyo, this place seems a bucolic paradise. Traditional,"
"1317",1317,"wooden Japanese architecture. Farming. The sense of harmony so markedly"
"1318",1318,"absent from the cities."
"1319",1319,"Algren, barely conscious, hunches over his horse. He has lost a lot of blood."
"1320",1320,"Katsumoto leads his samurai into the village. As he passes, ever y person in"
"1321",1321,"the village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect."
"1322",1322,"Most of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at Algren with"
"1323",1323,"curiosity. And suspicion."
"1324",1324,"Katsumoto dismounts in a large square, the rest of his men follow suit. A samurai"
"1325",1325,"helps Algren painfully slide from his horse."
"1326",1326,"Katsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house. His officers fall"
"1327",1327,"into formation around him. Algren notes Ujio - the grim samurai who killed"
"1328",1328,"Gant -- in jet black armor, glaring at him coldl y."
"1329",1329,"Ujio walks forward and SCREAMS at Algren in Japanese. Algren doesn't"
"1330",1330,"move. This only makes Ujio more angry. He paces back and forth like a"
"1331",1331,"caged panther spitting invective at Algren."
"1332",1332,"Algren doesn't move. He watches Uji o evenly. This takes incredible will."
"1333",1333,"His wounds are so bad that- he can barely stand."
"1334",1334,"SUDDENLY - Ujio draws his long sword -- it slashes through the air - the"
"1335",1335,"blade singing -- and stops an inch away from Algren's face!"
"1336",1336,"Algren doesn't move."
"1337",1337,"Ujio brings the cutting edge' into contact with Algren's check. Blood runs"
"1338",1338,"where even this feather-light touch cuts Algren's skin. Algren doesn't move."
"1339",1339,"Ujio glares at him. Then sheathes his sword and walks away."
"1340",1340,"Katsumoto looks at Algren deepl y, gauging him. Then be speaks. In English."
