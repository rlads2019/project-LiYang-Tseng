820,820,                    you needed. Maybe it's time you

2353,2353,                    Stan preys on the weak because he's

2355,2355,                    complex than that. According to

2357,2357,"                    bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under"

2363,2363,                    unable to use self-control so he
2364,2364,                    acts out aggressively. And the

5050,5050,                    me. I showed up at a party to drag
5051,5051,                    my son home. Could I be any more
5052,5052,                    embarrassing? And how many amazing
