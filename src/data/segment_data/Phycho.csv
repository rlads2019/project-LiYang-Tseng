"2",2," PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT"
"3",3,"	Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a "
"4",4,"	hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and "
"5",5,"	its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. "
"6",6,"	We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over "
"7",7,"	traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business "
"8",8,"	buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we "
"9",9,"	approach downtown section, the character of the city begins "
"10",10,"	to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We "
"11",11,"	see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-"
"12",12,"	vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.  "
"13",13,"	vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of "
"14",14,"	nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret."
"15",15,"	We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific "
"16",16,"	location. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its "
"17",17,"	exposed brick side great painted letters advertise \""Transients-"
"18",18,"	Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room.\"" We pause long enough "
"19",19,"	to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open, "
"20",20,"	curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so "
"21",21,"	characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward "
"22",22,"	with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is "
"23",23,"	raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to "
"24",24,"	three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants "
"25",25,"	of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are "
"26",26,"	close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame "
"27",27,"	is in shot. No sounds come from within the room."
"28",28,"	Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between "
"29",29,"	shade and sill, peep into the room."
"30",30,"	A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears "
"31",31,"	a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude "
"32",32,"	of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of "
"33",33,"	the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome "
"34",34,"	conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl "
"35",35,"	nearing the end of her twenties and her rope."
"36",36,"	A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure "
"37",37,"	visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then "
"38",38,"	start forward. As we pass under the window shade,"
"39",39,"							 "
"40",40,"	"
"41",41," THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)"
"42",42,"	A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow "
"43",43,"	bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the "
"44",44,"	bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-"
"45",45,"	top handbag are on the bureau."
"46",46,"	On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-"
"47",47,"	Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There "
"48",48,"	is no radio."
"49",49,"	The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt "
"50",50,"	and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man "
"51",51,"	with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting "
"52",52,"	his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at "
"53",53,"	Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps "
"54",54,"	her face turned away from him."
"55",55,"	After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans "
"56",56,"	over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, "
"57",57,"	holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed "
"58",58,"	and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an "
"59",59,"	inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow "
"60",60,"	Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns "
"61",61,"	at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, "
"62",62,"	playful voice."
"63",63,"				SAM"
"64",64,"		Never did eat your lunch, did you."
"65",65,"	Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, "
"66",66,"	kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings "
"67",67,"	her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds "
"68",68,"	her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally "
"69",69,"	pulls away and sits up."
"70",70,"				MARY"
"71",71,"		I better get back to the office.  "
"72",72,"		These extended lunch hours give my "
"73",73,"		boss excess acid."
"74",74,"	She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings "
"75",75,"	out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or "
"76",76,"	perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam "
"77",77,"	watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, "
"78",78,"	humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they "
"79",79,"	occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc."
"80",80,"				SAM"
"81",81,"		Call your boss and tell him you're "
"82",82,"		taking the rest of the afternoon "
"83",83,"		off. It's Friday anyway... and hot."
"84",84,"				MARY"
"85",85,"			(soft sarcasm)"
"86",86,"		What do I do with my free afternoon, "
"87",87,"		walk you to the airport?"
"88",88,"				SAM"
"89",89,"			(meaningfully)"
"90",90,"		We could laze around here a while "
"91",91,"		longer."
"92",92,"				MARY"
"93",93,"		Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels "
"94",94,"		of this sort aren't interested in "
"95",95,"		you when you come in, but when your "
"96",96,"		time's up..."
"97",97,"			(a small anguish)"
"98",98,"		Sam, I hate having to be with you in "
"99",99,"		a place like this."
"100",100,"				SAM"
"101",101,"		I've heard of married couples who "
"102",102,"		deliberately spend occasional nights "
"103",103,"		in cheap hotels. They say it..."
"104",104,"				MARY"
"105",105,"			(interrupting)"
"106",106,"		When you're married you can do a lot "
"107",107,"		of things deliberately."
"108",108,"				SAM"
"109",109,"		You sure talk like a girl who's been "
"110",110,"		married."
"111",111,"				MARY"
"112",112,"		Sam!"
"113",113,"				SAM"
"114",114,"		I'm sorry, Mary."
"115",115,"			(after a moment)"
"116",116,"		My old Dad used to say 'when you "
"117",117,"		can't change a situation, laugh at "
"118",118,"		it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like "
"119",119,"		laughing at it."
"120",120,"				MARY"
"121",121,"		I've lost my girlish laughter."
"122",122,"				SAM"
"123",123,"			(observing)"
"124",124,"		The only girlish thing you have lost."
"125",125,"				MARY"
"126",126,"			(a meaningful quiet, "
"127",127,"			then, with difficulty:)"
"128",128,"		Sam. This is the last time."
"129",129,"				SAM"
"130",130,"		For what?"
"131",131,"				MARY"
"132",132,"		This! Meeting you in secret so we "
"133",133,"		can be... secretive! You come down "
"134",134,"		here on business trips and we steal "
"135",135,"		lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't "
"136",136,"		even come."
"137",137,"				SAM"
"138",138,"		Okay. What do we do instead, write "
"139",139,"		each other lurid love letters?"
"140",140,"				MARY"
"141",141,"			(about to argue, then "
"142",142,"			turning away)"
"143",143,"		I haven't time to argue. I'm a working "
"144",144,"		girl."
"145",145,"				SAM"
"146",146,"		And I'm a working man! We're a regular "
"147",147,"		working-class tragedy!"
"148",148,"			(he laughs)"
"149",149,"				MARY"
"150",150,"		It is tragic! Or it will be... if we "
"151",151,"		go on meeting in shabby hotels "
"152",152,"		whenever you can find a tax-deductible "
"153",153,"		excuse for flying down deductible "
"154",154,"		here..."
"155",155,"				SAM"
"156",156,"			(interrupting, "
"157",157,"			seriously)"
"158",158,"		You can't laugh at it, huh?"
"159",159,"				MARY"
"160",160,"		Can you?"
"161",161,"				SAM"
"162",162,"		Sure. It's like laughing through a "
"163",163,"		broken jaw, but..."
"164",164,"	He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, "
"165",165,"	tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it."
"166",166,"	It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, "
"167",167,"	revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if "
"168",168,"	corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the "
"169",169,"	fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor "
"170",170,"	again."
"171",171,"				SAM"
"172",172,"		And besides, when you say I make tax-"
"173",173,"		deductible excuses you make me out a "
"174",174,"		criminal."
"175",175,"				MARY"
"176",176,"			(having to smile)"
"177",177,"		You couldn't be a criminal if you "
"178",178,"		committed a major crime."
"179",179,"				SAM"
"180",180,"		I wish I were. Not an active criminal "
"181",181,"		but... a nice guy with the conscience "
"182",182,"		of a criminal."
"183",183,"			(goes close to mary, "
"184",184,"			touches her)"
"185",185,"		Next best thing to no conscience at "
"186",186,"		all."
"187",187,"				MARY"
"188",188,"			(pulling away)"
"189",189,"		I have to go, Sam."
"190",190,"				SAM"
"191",191,"		I can come down next week."
"192",192,"				MARY"
"193",193,"		No."
"194",194,"				SAM"
"195",195,"		Not even just to see you, to have "
"196",196,"		lunch... in public?"
"197",197,"				MARY"
"198",198,"		We can see each other, we can even "
"199",199,"		have dinner... but respectably, in "
"200",200,"		my house with my mother's picture on "
"201",201,"		the mantel and my sister helping me "
"202",202,"		broil a big steak for three!"
"203",203,"				SAM"
"204",204,"		And after the steak... do we send "
"205",205,"		Sister to the movies and turn Mama's "
"206",206,"		picture to the wall?"
"207",207,"				MARY"
"208",208,"		Sam! No!"
"209",209,"				SAM"
"210",210,"			(after a pause, simply)"
"211",211,"		All right."
"212",212,"	She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue "
"213",213,"	the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised "
"214",214,"	when they discover men will continue to want them even after "
"215",215,"	the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, "
"216",216,"	places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and "
"217",217,"	simple sincerity."
"218",218,"				SAM"
"219",219,"		Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-"
"220",220,"		deductible or not, I want to see "
"221",221,"		deductible you. And under any "
"222",222,"		conditions."
"223",223,"			(a smile)"
"224",224,"		Even respectability."
"225",225,"				MARY"
"226",226,"		You make respectability sound...  "
"227",227,"		disrespectful."
"228",228,"				SAM"
"229",229,"			(brightly)"
"230",230,"		I'm all for it! It requires patience "
"231",231,"		and temperance and a lot of sweating-"
"232",232,"		out... otherwise, though, it's only "
"233",233,"		hard work."
"234",234,"			(a pause)"
"235",235,"		But if I can see you, touch you even "
"236",236,"		as simply as this... I won't mind."
"237",237,"	He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems "
"238",238,"	crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment."
"239",239,"				SAM"
"240",240,"		I'm fed up with sweating for people "
"241",241,"		who aren't there. I sweat to pay off "
"242",242,"		my father's debts... and he's in his "
"243",243,"		grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife "
"244",244,"		alimony, and she's living on the "
"245",245,"		other side of the world somewhere."
"246",246,"				MARY"
"247",247,"			(a smile)"
"248",248,"		I pay, too. They also pay who meet "
"249",249,"		in hotel rooms."
"250",250,"				SAM"
"251",251,"		A couple of years and the debts will "
"252",252,"		be paid off. And if she ever re-"
"253",253,"		marries, the alimony stops... and "
"254",254,"		then..."
"255",255,"				MARY"
"256",256,"		I haven't even been married once "
"257",257,"		yet!"
"258",258,"				SAM"
"259",259,"		Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing."
"260",260,"				MARY"
"261",261,"			(smiling, then with a "
"262",262,"			terrible urgency)"
"263",263,"		Sam, let's go get married."
"264",264,"				SAM"
"265",265,"		And live with me in a storeroom behind "
"266",266,"		a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll "
"267",267,"		have a lot of laughs. When I send my "
"268",268,"		ex-wife her money, you can lick the "
"269",269,"		stamps."
"270",270,"				MARY"
"271",271,"			(a deep desperation)"
"272",272,"		I'll lick the stamps."
"273",273,"	He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, "
"274",274,"	looks out the window and stares at the wide sky."
"275",275,"				SAM"
"276",276,"		You know what I'd like? A clear, "
"277",277,"		empty sky... and a plane, and us in "
"278",278,"		it... and somewhere a private island "
"279",279,"		for sale, where we can run around "
"280",280,"		without our... shoes on.  And the "
"281",281,"		wherewithal to buy what I'd like."
"282",282,"			(he moves away, "
"283",283,"			suddenly serious)"
"284",284,"		Mary, you want to cut this off, go "
"285",285,"		out and find yourself someone "
"286",286,"		available."
"287",287,"				MARY"
"288",288,"		I'm thinking of it."
"289",289,"				SAM"
"290",290,"			(a cheerful shout)"
"291",291,"		How can you even think a thing like "
"292",292,"		that!"
"293",293,"				MARY"
"294",294,"			(picking up handbag, "
"295",295,"			starting for door)"
"296",296,"		Don't miss your plane."
"297",297,"				SAM"
"298",298,"		Hey, we can leave together can't we?"
"299",299,"				MARY"
"300",300,"			(at door)"
"301",301,"		I'm late... and you have to put your "
"302",302,"		shoes on."
"303",303,"	Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares "
"304",304,"	down at his shoeless feet,"
"305",305,"							 "
"306",306,"	"
"307",307," DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE"
"308",308,"	Shooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly "
"309",309,"	to a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street."
"310",310,"						 DISSOLVE TO:"
"311",311,"	"
"312",312," LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)"
"313",313,"	A small, moderately successful office off the main street. A "
"314",314,"	cab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay "
"315",315,"	driver, cross pavement to the office door."
"316",316,"	"
"317",317," OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)"
"318",318,"	Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her "
"319",319,"	temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last "
"320",320,"	of her teens."
"321",321,"				MARY"
"322",322,"		Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?"
"323",323,"				CAROLINE"
"324",324,"			(a high, bright, eager-"
"325",325,"			to-talk voice laced "
"326",326,"			to-with a vague Texan "
"327",327,"			accent)"
"328",328,"		He's lunching with the man who's "
"329",329,"		buying the Harris Street property, "
"330",330,"		you know, that oil lease man...  so "
"331",331,"		that's why he's late."
"332",332,"			(a pause, then, as "
"333",333,"			Mary does not respond "
"334",334,"			to the pointed thrust)"
"335",335,"		You getting a headache?"
"336",336,"				MARY"
"337",337,"		It'll pass. Headaches are like "
"338",338,"		resolutions... you forget them soon "
"339",339,"		as they stop hurting."
"340",340,"				CAROLINE"
"341",341,"		You got aspirins? I have something... "
"342",342,"		not aspirins, but"
"343",343,"			(cheerfully takes "
"344",344,"			bottle of pills out "
"345",345,"			of desk drawer)"
"346",346,"		my mother's doctor gave these to me "
"347",347,"		the day of my wedding."
"348",348,"			(laughs)"
"349",349,"		Teddy was furious when he found out "
"350",350,"		I'd taken tranquilizers!"
"351",351,"	She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand."
"352",352,"				MARY"
"353",353,"		Were there any calls?"
"354",354,"				CAROLINE"
"355",355,"		Teddy called.  Me... And my mother "
"356",356,"		called to see if Teddy called. Oh, "
"357",357,"		and your sister called to say she's "
"358",358,"		going to Tucson to do some buying "
"359",359,"		and she'll be gone the whole weekend "
"360",360,"		and..."
"361",361,"	She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. "
"362",362,"	MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the "
"363",363,"	office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a "
"364",364,"	trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-"
"365",365,"	hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful "
"366",366,"	vulgarity."
"367",367,"				CASSIDY"
"368",368,"		Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls "
"369",369,"		should get your boss to air-condition "
"370",370,"		you up. He can afford it today."
"371",371,"	Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead "
"372",372,"	Cassidy toward the private office."
"373",373,"				LOWERY"
"374",374,"		Mary, will you get those copies of "
"375",375,"		the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy."
"376",376,"	Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the "
"377",377,"	desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary."
"378",378,"				CASSIDY"
"379",379,"		Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little "

"381",381,"			(laughs as Mary looks "

"383",383,"		Not you, my daughter!  A baby, and "
"384",384,"		tomorrow she stands up there and "
"385",385,"		gets her sweet self married away "
"386",386,"		from me!"
"387",387,"			(pulling out wallet)"
"388",388,"		I want you to look at my baby.  "
"389",389,"		Eighteen years old... and she's never "
"390",390,"		had an unhappy day in any one of "
"391",391,"		those years!"
"392",392,"			(flashes photo)"
"393",393,"	Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some "
"394",394,"	remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore "
"395",395,"	the man's hot-breath closeness."
"396",396,"				LOWERY"
"397",397,"		Come on, Tom, my office is air-"
"398",398,"		conditioned."

"408",408,"				CASSIDY"
"409",409,"		I'm buying this house for my baby's "
"410",410,"		wedding present. Forty thousand "
"411",411,"		dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying "
"412",412,"		happiness, that's buying off "
"413",413,"		unhappiness! That penniless punk "

"415",415,"			(laughs)"
"416",416,"		Probably a good kid... it's just "

"419",419,"		Yup! Forty thousand, says here..."
"420",420,"			(to Lowery)"
"421",421,"		Casharoonie!"

"1575",1575,"		Eating in an office..."
"1576",1576,"			(a rueful smile)"
"1577",1577,"		...to officious, even for me. I have "
"1578",1578,"		the parlor behind this... if you'd "
"1579",1579,"		like."
"1580",1580,"	Mary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and into the "
"1581",1581,"	darkened parlor. Mary follows."
"1582",1582,"	"
"1583",1583," NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)"
"1584",1584,"	In the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office "
"1585",1585,"	spilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary "
"1586",1586,"	comes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to "
"1587",1587,"	lamp, turns on the light."
"1588",1588,"	Mary is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one "
"1589",1589,"	lamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes "
"1590",1590,"	up at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over "
"1591",1591,"	the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to "
"1592",1592,"	the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are "
"1593",1593,"	of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary "
"1594",1594,"	stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror."
"1595",1595,"	CLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN"
"1596",1596,"				NORMAN"
"1597",1597,"		Please sit down. On the sofa."
"1598",1598,"	As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and "
"1599",1599,"	pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies "
"1600",1600,"	the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked "
"1601",1601,"	with books on the subject of \""Taxidermy.\"""
"1602",1602,"	CLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY"
"1603",1603,"	She notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, "
"1604",1604,"	and many with a vaguely religious overtone."
"1605",1605,"	Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread."
"1606",1606,"				MARY"
"1607",1607,"		You're very... kind."
"1608",1608,"				NORMAN"
"1609",1609,"		It's all for you. I'm not hungry.  "
"1610",1610,"		Please go ahead."
"1611",1611,"	Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a "
"1612",1612,"	small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in "
"1613",1613,"	the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied."
"1614",1614,"	Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles "
"1615",1615,"	and then laughs."
"1616",1616,"				NORMAN"
"1617",1617,"		You eat like a bird."
"1618",1618,"				MARY"
"1619",1619,"		You'd know, of course."
"1620",1620,"				NORMAN"
"1621",1621,"		Not really. I hear that expression, "
"1622",1622,"		that one eats \""like a bird,\"" is really "
"1623",1623,"		a falsie, I mean a falsity, because "
"1624",1624,"		birds eat a tremendous lot."
"1625",1625,"			(A pause, then "
"1626",1626,"			explaining)"
"1627",1627,"		Oh, I don't know anything about birds. "
"1628",1628,"		My hobby is stuffing things... "
"1629",1629,"		taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather "
"1630",1630,"		stuff birds because...  well, I hate "
"1631",1631,"		the look of beasts when they're "
"1632",1632,"		stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... "
"1633",1633,"		some people even stuff dogs and "
"1634",1634,"		cats... but I can't... I think only "
"1635",1635,"		birds look well stuffed because "
"1636",1636,"		they're rather...  passive, to begin "
"1637",1637,"		with... most of them..."
"1638",1638,"	He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return "
"1639",1639,"	of his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him, "
"1640",1640,"	with some compression, smiles."
"1641",1641,"				MARY"
"1642",1642,"		It's a strange hobby. Curious, I "
"1643",1643,"		mean."
"1644",1644,"				NORMAN"
"1645",1645,"		Uncommon, too."
"1646",1646,"				MARY"
"1647",1647,"		I imagine so."
"1648",1648,"				NORMAN"
"1649",1649,"		It's not as expensive as you'd think. "
"1650",1650,"		Cheap, really. Needles, thread, "
"1651",1651,"		sawdust .. the chemicals are all "
"1652",1652,"		that cost anything."
"1653",1653,"			(He goes quiet, looks "
"1654",1654,"			disturbed)"
"1655",1655,"				MARY"
"1656",1656,"		A man should have a hobby."
"1657",1657,"				NORMAN"
"1658",1658,"		It's more than a hobby... sometimes... "
"1659",1659,"		a hobby is supposed to pass the time, "

"1665",1665,"		Oh, no!"
"1666",1666,"			(forcing brightness "
"1667",1667,"			again)"
"1668",1668,"		I run the office, tend the cabins "

"1672",1672,"				MARY"
"1673",1673,"		You go out... with friends?"

"1675",1675,"		Friends? Who needs friends."
"1676",1676,"			(Laughs, then with "

"1695",1695,"				NORMAN"

"1698",1698,"			(A pause)"
"1699",1699,"		The rain didn't last very long."
"1700",1700,"			(Turning suddenly)"
"1701",1701,"		You know what I think? I think we're "
"1702",1702,"		all in our private traps, clamped in "
"1703",1703,"		them, and none of us can ever climb "
"1704",1704,"		out. We scratch and claw... but only "
"1705",1705,"		at the air, only at each other, and "
"1706",1706,"		for all of it, we never budge an "
"1707",1707,"		inch."
"1708",1708,"				MARY"
"1709",1709,"		Sometimes we deliberately step into "

"1727",1727,"				NORMAN"
"1728",1728,"			(Controlled resentment)"
"1729",1729,"		Sometimes when she talks that way to "

"1734",1734,"			(A pause, a hopeless "

"1746",1746,"		out to work or anything, Dad left us "
"1747",1747,"		with a little something... anyway, a "
"1748",1748,"		few years ago... Mother met a man. "
"1749",1749,"		He talked her into building this "

"1752",1752,"		It was just too much for her when he "
"1753",1753,"		died, too... And the way he died... "
"1754",1754,"		Oh, it's nothing to talk about when "
"1755",1755,"		you're eating."
"1756",1756,"			(Pauses, smiles)"
"1757",1757,"		Anyway, it was too much of a loss "

"1760",1760,"				MARY"
"1761",1761,"			(Critically)"

"1773",1773,"		No, not like me."
"1774",1774,"				NORMAN"
"1775",1775,"		It's too late for me. And besides... "
"1776",1776,"		who'd look after her? She'd be alone "
"1777",1777,"		up there, the fire would go out... "
"1778",1778,"		damp and cold, like a grave. When "
"1779",1779,"		you love someone, you don't do that "
"1780",1780,"		to them, even if you hate them. Oh, "
"1781",1781,"		I don't hate her.  I hate... what "

"1783",1783,"				MARY"
"1784",1784,"			(Slowly, carefully)"
"1785",1785,"		Wouldn't it be better if you put her "
"1786",1786,"		in... someplace..."
"1787",1787,"	She hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a "

"1816",1816,"	The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks "

"1818",1818,"	Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained "

"1820",1820,"				NORMAN"
"1821",1821,"			(Quietly)"
"1822",1822,"		I've suggested it myself. But I hate "

"1891",1891,"	his face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of "
"1892",1892,"	determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts "
"1893",1893,"	to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of "
"1894",1894,"	Mary's door in the cabin next door."

"1900",1900,"	The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft "
"1901",1901,"	SOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet. Norman turns "
"1902",1902,"	his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting "
"1903",1903,"	an impulse to listen, or more than listen."
"1904",1904,"	But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, "
"1905",1905,"	resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of "
"1906",1906,"	his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too "
"1907",1907,"	had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a "
"1908",1908,"	picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning "
"1909",1909,"	against. Slowly he starts toward it."
"1910",1910,"	He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame "

"1912",1912,"	A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the "
"1913",1913,"	hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is "
"1914",1914,"	very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light "
"1915",1915,"	striking Norman's face."
"1916",1916,"	We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile "
"1917",1917,"	fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See "

"1921",1921,"	Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary "

"1952",1952,"	holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage "
"1953",1953,"	evaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-"
"1954",1954,"	passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen. "
"1955",1955,"	At the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops "
"1956",1956,"	wearily into a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg "
"1957",1957,"	and gently pushes the kitchen door closed."

"1960",1960," MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)"
"1961",1961,"	Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a "
"1962",1962,"	small notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which "
"1963",1963,"	indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money "
"1964",1964,"	she has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her "
"1965",1965,"	bankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly "
"1966",1966,"	beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after "
"1967",1967,"	subtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which "
"1968",1968,"	matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00."
"1969",1969,"	Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after "
"1970",1970,"	subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not "
"1971",1971,"	wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure "
"1972",1972,"	that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to "
"1973",1973,"	continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the "
"1974",1974,"	page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into "
"1975",1975,"	small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces "
"1976",1976,"	into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her "
"1977",1977,"	robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on."

"1979",1979," MARY IN SHOWER"
"1980",1980,"	Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see "
"1981",1981,"	the bathroom door, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch "
"1982",1982,"	Mary as she washes and soaps herself."
"1983",1983,"	There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she "
"1984",1984,"	looks somewhat relieved."
"1985",1985,"	Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open."
"1986",1986,"	The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is "
"1987",1987,"	then slowly and carefully closed."
"1988",1988,"	And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower "
"1989",1989,"	curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white "
"1990",1990,"	brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding."
"1991",1991,"	Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, "
"1992",1992,"	rip it aside."

"1995",1995,"	As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower "
"1996",1996,"	curtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in "
"1997",1997,"	her face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her "
"1998",1998,"	throat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous "
"1999",1999,"	bread knife. The flint of the blade shatters the screen to "
"2000",2000,"	an almost total, silver blankness."
"2001",2001,"	THE SLASHING"
"2002",2002,"	An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very "

"2007",2007,"	The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand "
"2008",2008,"	pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a "
"2009",2009,"	glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with "
"2010",2010,"	madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a "
"2011",2011,"	fright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across "
"2012",2012,"	the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the "
"2013",2013,"	shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a "

"2019",2019,"	popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.  "
"2020",2020,"	Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along "
"2021",2021,"	the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA "
"2022",2022,"	FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the "
"2023",2023,"	bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA "
"2024",2024,"	approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed "

"2026",2026,"	CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER"

"2035",2035,"	After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the "

"2042",2042,"	his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman "
"2043",2043,"	runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's "

"2049",2049,"	He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body."
"2050",2050,"	Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, "
"2051",2051,"	covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the "
"2052",2052,"	window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we "
"2053",2053,"	see the bedside table with the newspaper on it."
"2054",2054,"	After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the "
"2055",2055,"	edge of the bed."
"2056",2056,"	FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN"
"2057",2057,"	Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can "
"2058",2058,"	see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile "
"2059",2059,"	floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of "
"2060",2060,"	his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the "
"2061",2061,"	peace that comes with decision."
"2062",2062,"	Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with "
"2063",2063,"	resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across "
"2064",2064,"	it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, "
"2065",2065,"	and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the "
"2066",2066,"	bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from "

"2073",2073,"	then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the "
"2074",2074,"	office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door "
"2075",2075,"	opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman "
"2076",2076,"	comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, "
"2077",2077,"	goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into "

"2083",2083,"	gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him "
"2084",2084,"	set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower "
"2085",2085,"	being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES "
"2086",2086,"	FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom."
"2087",2087,"	CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up. "
"2088",2088,"	Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges "

"2090",2090,"	spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside "

"2092",2092,"	it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over "
"2093",2093,"	and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and "
"2094",2094,"	CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. "
"2095",2095,"	He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his "

"2097",2097,"	across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain "
"2098",2098,"	in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up, "
"2099",2099,"	examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to "
"2100",2100,"	the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin."

"2107",2107,"	He places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the "
"2108",2108,"	mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the "
"2109",2109,"	wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and "
"2110",2110,"	even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel "
"2111",2111,"	and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.  "
"2112",2112,"	Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, "

"2119",2119,"	where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up "

"2126",2126,"	directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go."
"2127",2127,"	Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key "

"2133",2133,"	the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he "
"2134",2134,"	picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his "
"2135",2135,"	foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind "
"2136",2136,"	him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body "
"2137",2137,"	in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. "
"2138",2138,"	He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, "

"2143",2143,"	with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to "
"2144",2144,"	gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase. "
"2145",2145,"	He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks "
"2146",2146,"	under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that "

"2148",2148,"	carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the "
"2149",2149,"	suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl "
"2150",2150,"	are gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks "
"2151",2151,"	it up."
"2152",2152,"	With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the "

"2161",2161,"	flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman "
"2162",2162,"	to regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the "
"2163",2163,"	car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and "
"2164",2164,"	the pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then "
"2165",2165,"	realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin. "
"2166",2166,"	He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the "

"2169",2169,"	goes right over the toilet bowl."

"2184",2184,"	realizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases "
"2185",2185,"	the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car "
"2186",2186,"	begins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW, "
"2187",2187,"	THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens."
"2188",2188,"	The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane "
"2189",2189,"	flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps "
"2190",2190,"	away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the "

"2200",2200,"	More than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp. "
"2201",2201,"	The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, "

"2204",2204,"	slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear "
"2205",2205,"	only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only "
"2206",2206,"	the small after-bubble, like a visual burp."
"2207",2207,"	Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire "

"2215",2215,"	of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down "
"2216",2216,"	and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground "
"2217",2217,"	outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the "
"2218",2218,"	tire marks."
"2219",2219,"	After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, "
"2220",2220,"	places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see "
"2221",2221,"	that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the "
"2222",2222,"	road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a "
"2223",2223,"	car had been parked here."
"2224",2224,"	After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it "
"2225",2225,"	off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away "
"2226",2226,"	from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that "
"2227",2227,"	leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps "

"2270",2270,"		not it's painless. And I say insect "

"2273",2273,"	CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware "
"2274",2274,"	store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. "
"2275",2275,"	She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a "
"2276",2276,"	look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small "
"2277",2277,"	overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE."
"2278",2278,"	Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, "
"2279",2279,"	gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod."
"2280",2280,"	Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her "
"2281",2281,"	eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:"
"2282",2282,"				LILA"
"2283",2283,"		Sam?"
"2284",2284,"				SUMMERFIELD"
"2285",2285,"		You want to see Sam?"
"2286",2286,"				LILA"
"2287",2287,"		Sam Loomis."
"2288",2288,"				SUMMERFIELD"
"2289",2289,"			(yelling toward back "
"2290",2290,"			room)"
"2291",2291,"		Sam! Lady wants to see you!"
"2292",2292,"	Lila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on "
"2293",2293,"	worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. "
"2294",2294,"	Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a "
"2295",2295,"	moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he "
"2296",2296,"	does not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried "
"2297",2297,"	expression."
"2298",2298,"				SAM"
"2299",2299,"		Yes?"
"2300",2300,"				LILA"
"2301",2301,"		May I talk to you?"
"2302",2302,"				SAM"
"2303",2303,"			(a bit mystified)"
"2304",2304,"		Sure..."
"2305",2305,"	Lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts "
"2306",2306,"	toward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then "
"2307",2307,"	follows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him "
"2308",2308,"	intently as she says:"
"2309",2309,"				LILA"
"2310",2310,"		I'm Mary's sister."
"2311",2311,"				SAM"
"2312",2312,"		Lila."
"2313",2313,"				LILA"
"2314",2314,"			(quickly)"
"2315",2315,"		Is Mary here?"
"2316",2316,"	Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile "
"2317",2317,"	expression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment. "
"2318",2318,"	Behind them is a display of various size carving knives."
"2319",2319,"				SAM"
"2320",2320,"		Is something wrong?"
"2321",2321,"				LILA"
"2322",2322,"		I want to know if my sister is here."
"2323",2323,"				SAM"
"2324",2324,"		Here?"
"2325",2325,"				LILA"
"2326",2326,"		With you."
"2327",2327,"				SAM"
"2328",2328,"		Where?"
"2329",2329,"				LILA"
"2330",2330,"		I don't know where. In your store, "
"2331",2331,"		somewhere in your town... anywhere."
"2332",2332,"				SAM"
"2333",2333,"		What's the matter?"
"2334",2334,"				LILA"
"2335",2335,"		Don't you know?"
"2336",2336,"	As Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing "
"2337",2337,"	past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile."
"2338",2338,"				WOMAN CUSTOMER"
"2339",2339,"		All I can do is hope if it isn't "
"2340",2340,"		painless, it's quick!"
"2341",2341,"	She speaks \""quick\"" with a kind of delicious bite, nods "
"2342",2342,"	happily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring "
"2343",2343,"	apprehensively at Lila."
"2344",2344,"				SAM"
"2345",2345,"		What should I know?"
"2346",2346,"				LILA"
"2347",2347,"		To begin with, where Mary is. Do "
"2348",2348,"		you?"
"2349",2349,"				SAM"
"2350",2350,"		No. I take it you don't either?"
"2351",2351,"			(As Lila shakes her "
"2352",2352,"			head)"
"2353",2353,"		How long?"
"2354",2354,"				LILA"
"2355",2355,"		Last Friday. She left work, and "
"2356",2356,"		home... I was in Tucson over the "
"2357",2357,"		weekend... I haven't heard from her, "
"2358",2358,"		not even a phone call."
"2359",2359,"				SAM"
"2360",2360,"		And you thought she'd come up here, "
"2361",2361,"		to me? If she had, what reason would "
"2362",2362,"		she have for not calling you?"
"2363",2363,"				LILA"
"2364",2364,"		A good reason, I suppose."
"2365",2365,"				SAM"
"2366",2366,"			(Slightly exasperated)"
"2367",2367,"		Well what do you think, we eloped or "
"2368",2368,"		something? Or we're living in sin "
"2369",2369,"		and..."
"2370",2370,"				LILA"
"2371",2371,"		Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being "
"2372",2372,"		defensive that you haven't even "
"2373",2373,"		reacted to the most serious fact of "
"2374",2374,"		all. Mary is missing."
"2375",2375,"				SAM"
"2376",2376,"		I was getting to that!"
"2377",2377,"				LILA"
"2378",2378,"		What do you know about it?"
"2379",2379,"				SAM"
"2380",2380,"		Nothing! You're putting me on the "
"2381",2381,"		defensive."
"2382",2382,"				LILA"
"2383",2383,"		Look, if you two are in this thing "
"2384",2384,"		together, I don't care, it's none of "
"2385",2385,"		my business... But I want to see "
"2386",2386,"		Mary. I want her to tell me she's "
"2387",2387,"		all right and it's none of my "
"2388",2388,"		business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix "
"2389",2389,"		and..."
"2390",2390,"	She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes "
"2391",2391,"	beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a "
"2392",2392,"	moment, then turns and calls:"
"2393",2393,"				SAM"
"2394",2394,"		Bob? Run out and get yourself some "
"2395",2395,"		lunch."
"2396",2396,"				SUMMERFIELD"
"2397",2397,"		It's okay, Sam, I brought it with "
"2398",2398,"		me."
"2399",2399,"				SAM"
"2400",2400,"		Run out and eat it."
"2401",2401,"	Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way."
"2402",2402,"	Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness."
"2403",2403,"				SAM"
"2404",2404,"		What thing?"
"2405",2405,"				LILA"
"2406",2406,"		Huh?"
"2407",2407,"				SAM"
"2408",2408,"		What thing could we be in together?"
"2409",2409,"				LILA"
"2410",2410,"			(A pause)"
"2411",2411,"		I hate tears."
"2412",2412,"			(Takes out hankie)"
"2413",2413,"				SAM"
"2414",2414,"		Is Mary... in trouble?"
"2415",2415,"				LILA"
"2416",2416,"		Yes."
"2417",2417,"				SAM"
"2418",2418,"		Well why didn't she come to me...  "
"2419",2419,"		call me...?"
"2420",2420,"				LILA"
"2421",2421,"		Not that kind..."
"2422",2422,"			(Almost a smile)"
"2423",2423,"		You men and your egos."
"2424",2424,"				SAM"
"2425",2425,"			(Seriously)"
"2426",2426,"		Never mind my ego. Let's talk about "
"2427",2427,"		Mary."
"2428",2428,"	Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled "
"2429",2429,"	quietly into the room. He ignores them, walks past them, "
"2430",2430,"	goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading \""CLOSED "
"2431",2431,"	FOR LUNCH,\"" walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the "
"2432",2432,"	sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam "
"2433",2433,"	and Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly "
"2434",2434,"	smile."
"2435",2435,"				ARBOGAST"
"2436",2436,"		Let's all talk about Mary."
"2437",2437,"				SAM"
"2438",2438,"		Who are you, friend?"
"2439",2439,"				ARBOGAST"
"2440",2440,"		Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator."
"2441",2441,"			(To Lila)"
"2442",2442,"		Where is she, Miss Crane?"
"2443",2443,"				LILA"
"2444",2444,"		I don't know."
"2445",2445,"				ARBOGAST"
"2446",2446,"		Wouldn't have been able to tail you "
"2447",2447,"		if you did."
"2448",2448,"				SAM"
"2449",2449,"		What's your interest?"
"2450",2450,"				ARBOGAST"
"2451",2451,"		Money."
"2452",2452,"	There is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the "
"2453",2453,"	sudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes."
"2454",2454,"				SAM"
"2455",2455,"		Somebody better tell me what's going "
"2456",2456,"		on and tell me fast! I can take so "
"2457",2457,"		much and then..."
"2458",2458,"				ARBOGAST"
"2459",2459,"			(Interrupting calmly)"
"2460",2460,"		Your girl friend stole forty thousand "
"2461",2461,"		dollars."
"2462",2462,"	Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks "
"2463",2463,"	one of those seemingly ridiculous questions."
"2464",2464,"				SAM"
"2465",2465,"		Why?"
"2466",2466,"				ARBOGAST"
"2467",2467,"			(An almost amused "
"2468",2468,"			smile)"
"2469",2469,"		Must've needed it."
"2470",2470,"				SAM"
"2471",2471,"		What are you talking about?"
"2472",2472,"			(To Lila)"
"2473",2473,"		What is this?"
"2474",2474,"				LILA"
"2475",2475,"		She was supposed to bank it, on "
"2476",2476,"		Friday, for her boss. She didn't."
"2477",2477,"	And no one has seen her since."
"2478",2478,"				ARBOGAST"
"2479",2479,"			(Looking at Sam)"
"2480",2480,"		Someone has seen her. Someone always "
"2481",2481,"		sees a girl with forty thousand "
"2482",2482,"		dollars."
"2483",2483,"			(To Sam)"
"2484",2484,"		She is your girl friend, isn't she?"
"2485",2485,"				LILA"
"2486",2486,"		Sam, they don't want to prosecute, "
"2487",2487,"		they just want the money back. It "
"2488",2488,"		was all in cash..."
"2489",2489,"				ARBOGAST"
"2490",2490,"			(Correcting with "
"2491",2491,"			Cassidy's word)"
"2492",2492,"		Casharoonie!"
"2493",2493,"				LILA"
"2494",2494,"		Sam, if she's here..."
"2495",2495,"				SAM"
"2496",2496,"		She isn't!"
"2497",2497,"	A real look of anguish comes into Lila's face. And Arbogast "
"2498",2498,"	studies it, then speaks."
"2499",2499,"				ARBOGAST"
"2500",2500,"		You came up here on a hunch, Miss "
"2501",2501,"		Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... "
"2502",2502,"		from him, or from your sister herself?"
"2503",2503,"				LILA"
"2504",2504,"			(wearily)"
"2505",2505,"		Not even a hunch. Just hope."
"2506",2506,"				ARBOGAST"
"2507",2507,"		With a little checking, I could get "
"2508",2508,"		to believe you."
"2509",2509,"				LILA"
"2510",2510,"			(anxiously)"
"2511",2511,"		I don't care if you do or... I want "
"2512",2512,"		to see Mary... before she gets in "
"2513",2513,"		any deeper..."
"2514",2514,"				SAM"
"2515",2515,"		Did you check in Phoenix... "
"2516",2516,"		hospitals... maybe she had an "
"2517",2517,"		accident... a hold-up..."
"2518",2518,"				ARBOGAST"
"2519",2519,"		She was seen leaving town in her "
"2520",2520,"		car. Seen by her very victims, I "
"2521",2521,"		might add."
"2522",2522,"				SAM"
"2523",2523,"			(after a moment)"
"2524",2524,"		I don't believe it."
"2525",2525,"			(to Lila, slowly)"
"2526",2526,"		Do you?"
"2527",2527,"				LILA"
"2528",2528,"			(a thoughtful pause)"
"2529",2529,"		Yes... I just... did. The moment "
"2530",2530,"		they told me..."
"2531",2531,"				SAM"
"2532",2532,"		You might have doubted for say five "
"2533",2533,"		minutes or so, Sister."
"2534",2534,"	Lila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face. "
"2535",2535,"	Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically."
"2536",2536,"				ARBOGAST"
"2537",2537,"		We're always quickest to doubt people "
"2538",2538,"		who have a record for being honest.  "
"2539",2539,"		I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where "
"2540",2540,"		there's a boyfriend..."
"2541",2541,"			(Trails off, smiles "
"2542",2542,"			encouragingly)"
"2543",2543,"		She won't be back there among the "

"2546",2546,"		her."
"2547",2547,"	He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to "
"2548",2548,"	the counter, opens door, goes out into the street."
"2549",2549,"	After a quiet moment:"
"2550",2550,"				LILA"
"2551",2551,"		I just listened... and believed "

"2556",2556,"				SAM"

"2563",2563,"				SAM"
"2564",2564,"		He must have had a darn good reason "

"2583",2583,"		If she did steal that money...  It's "

"2834",2834,"		I shouldn't even bother to change "

"2837",2837,"	He goes to the wall, flips a light switch."
"2838",2838,"				NORMAN"
"2839",2839,"		The vacancy sign. Just in case."
"2840",2840,"	We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't "

"2858",2858,"	Norman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the "
"2859",2859,"	registry book around, flips back a page or two."
"2860",2860,"	Norman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faintly, "
"2861",2861,"	pleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then:"

"2863",2863,"		Yes sir! Marie Samuels.  Interesting "

"2865",2865,"	He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside "
"2866",2866,"	the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding "
"2867",2867,"	and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as "
"2868",2868,"	happy as it is making him."
"2869",2869,"				ARBOGAST"
"2870",2870,"		Don't know where she got \""Marie,\"" "

"2886",2886,"		Tell me all about her."
"2887",2887,"				NORMAN"
"2888",2888,"		She arrived kind of late, wet and "

"2915",2915,"		No! Of all..."
"2916",2916,"				ARBOGAST"
"2917",2917,"		How do you know she didn't make a "

"2919",2919,"				NORMAN"
"2920",2920,"		She was tired. She said she had a "
"2921",2921,"		long drive ahead of her, in the "
"2922",2922,"		morning... Yes, now I'm remembering "
"2923",2923,"		very clearly because I'm picturing. "
"2924",2924,"		When you make a picture of the moment "
"2925",2925,"		in your mind, you can remember every "

"2927",2927,"		no she was standing up, with some "
"2928",2928,"		sandwich still in her hand, and she "
"2929",2929,"		said she had to drive a long way."
"2930",2930,"				ARBOGAST"
"2931",2931,"		Back where?"
"2932",2932,"				NORMAN"
"2933",2933,"		What do you mean?"
"2934",2934,"				ARBOGAST"
"2935",2935,"		You said she was sitting \""back there,\"" "
"2936",2936,"		or standing rather..."
"2937",2937,"				NORMAN"
"2938",2938,"		Oh. My private parlor. She had an "
"2939",2939,"		awful hunger... so I made her some "
"2940",2940,"		supper. And then she went to bed and "
"2941",2941,"		left in the morning. I didn't even "
"2942",2942,"		see her leave."
"2943",2943,"				ARBOGAST"
"2944",2944,"		How did she pay you?"
"2945",2945,"				NORMAN"
"2946",2946,"		What?"
"2947",2947,"				ARBOGAST"
"2948",2948,"		Cash or check? For the cabin..."

"2950",2950,"		Cash."
"2951",2951,"				ARBOGAST"

"2968",2968,"		Not at all!"
"2969",2969,"				ARBOGAST"
"2970",2970,"		Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, "

"2975",2975,"		Look, if you won't believe me, go "

"2988",2988,"	Arbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch, "
"2989",2989,"	but is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of "
"2990",2990,"	the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old "
"2991",2991,"	house. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the "

"2993",2993,"				NORMAN"
"2994",2994,"		Change your mind?"

"3429",3429,"	A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses "

"3444",3444,"				SAM"
"3445",3445,"		No. I'm just procrastinating.  People "

"3450",3450,"	He gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila. She is already "

"3452",3452,"	Sam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost "
"3453",3453,"	knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST "
"3454",3454,"	OF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like "
"3455",3455,"	a fire alarm than a doorbell."
"3456",3456,"	He tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The "
"3457",3457,"	downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is "

"4882",4882,"	A young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into "

"4884",4884,"	He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has "

"4929",4929,"			(nods, astounded, "
"4930",4930,"			then:)"
"4931",4931,"		Did he confess to..."
"4932",4932,"				SIMON"
"4933",4933,"			(interrupting)"
"4934",4934,"		As I said, the mother..."
"4935",4935,"			(Pauses, goes on afresh)"
"4936",4936,"		To understand it, as I understood it "
"4937",4937,"		hearing it from the mother...  That "
"4938",4938,"		is, from the mother-half of Norman's "
"4939",4939,"		mind, you have to go back ten years... "
"4940",4940,"		to the time when Norman murdered his "
"4941",4941,"		mother and her lover."
"4942",4942,"			(A pause, then as no "
"4943",4943,"			one interrupts)"
"4944",4944,"		He was already dangerously disturbed, "
"4945",4945,"		had been ever since his father died. "
"4946",4946,"		His mother was a clinging, demanding "
"4947",4947,"		woman... and for years the two of "
"4948",4948,"		them lived as if there was no one "
"4949",4949,"		else in the world. Then she met a "
"4950",4950,"		man and it seemed to Norman she \""threw "
"4951",4951,"		him over\"" for this man. That pushed "
"4952",4952,"		him over the thin line... and he "
"4953",4953,"		killed them both. Matricide is "
"4954",4954,"		probably the most unbearable crime "
"4955",4955,"		of all... and most unbearable to the "
"4956",4956,"		son who commit it. So he had to erase "
"4957",4957,"		the crime, at least in his own mind."
"4958",4958,"			(A pause)"
"4959",4959,"		He stole her corpse... and a weighted "
"4960",4960,"		coffin was buried. He hid the body "
"4961",4961,"		in the fruit cellar, even \""treated\"" "
"4962",4962,"		it to keep it as well as it would "
"4963",4963,"		keep. And that still wasn't enough. "
"4964",4964,"		She was there, but she was a corpse.  "
"4965",4965,"		So he began to think and speak for "
"4966",4966,"		her, gave her half his life, so to "
"4967",4967,"		speak. At times he could be both "
"4968",4968,"		personalities, carry on "
"4969",4969,"		conversations... at other times, the "
"4970",4970,"		mother-half took over completely. He "
"4971",4971,"		was never all Norman, but he was "
"4972",4972,"		often only mother. And because he "
"4973",4973,"		was so pathologically jealous of "
"4974",4974,"		her, he assumed she was as jealous "
"4975",4975,"		of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong "
"4976",4976,"		attraction to any other woman, the "
"4977",4977,"		mother side of him would go wild."
"4978",4978,"			(To Lila)"
"4979",4979,"		When Norman met your sister, he was "
"4980",4980,"		touched by her... and aroused by "
"4981",4981,"		her. He wanted her. And this set off "
"4982",4982,"		his \""jealous mother\"" and...  \""mother "
"4983",4983,"		killed the girl.\"" After the murder, "
"4984",4984,"		Norman returned as if from a deep "
"4985",4985,"		sleep... and like a dutiful son, "
"4986",4986,"		covered up all traces of the crime "
"4987",4987,"		he was convinced his mother had "
"4988",4988,"		committed."
"4989",4989,"				SAM"
"4990",4990,"		Why was he... dressed like that?"
"4991",4991,"				DISTRICT ATTORNEY"
"4992",4992,"		He's a transvestite!"
"4993",4993,"				SIMON"
"4994",4994,"		Not exactly. A man who dresses in "
"4995",4995,"		woman's clothing in order to achieve "
"4996",4996,"		a sexual change... or satisfaction... "
"4997",4997,"		is a transvestite.  But in Norman's "
"4998",4998,"		case, he was simply doing everything "
"4999",4999,"		possible to keep alive the illusion "
"5000",5000,"		of his mother being alive. And "
"5001",5001,"		whenever reality came too close, "
"5002",5002,"		when danger or desire threatened "
"5003",5003,"		that illusion, he'd dress up, even "
"5004",5004,"		to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd "
"5005",5005,"		walk about the house, sit in her "
"5006",5006,"		chair, speak in her voice... He tried "
"5007",5007,"		to be his mother."
"5008",5008,"			(A sad smile)"
"5009",5009,"		And now he is."
"5010",5010,"			(A pause)"
"5011",5011,"		That's what I meant when I said I "
"5012",5012,"		got the story from the mother. She "
"5013",5013,"		thinks Norman has been taken away... "
"5014",5014,"		because of his crimes.  She insists "
"5015",5015,"		she did nothing, that Norman committed "
"5016",5016,"		all the murders just to keep her "
"5017",5017,"		from being discovered. She even smiled "
"5018",5018,"		a bit coquettishly as she said that. "
"5019",5019,"		Of course, she feels badly about "
"5020",5020,"		it... but also somewhat relieved to "
"5021",5021,"		be, as she put it, free of Norman, "
"5022",5022,"		at last."
"5023",5023,"			(A pause)"
"5024",5024,"		When the mind houses two "
"5025",5025,"		personalities, there is always a "
"5026",5026,"		battle. In Norman's case, the battle "
"5027",5027,"		is over... and the dominant "
"5028",5028,"		personality has won."
"5029",5029,"	Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for "
"5030",5030,"	Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. "
"5031",5031,"	Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her."

"5039",5039,"	A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-"

"5042",5042,"				POLICE GUARD"
"5043",5043,"		He feels a little chill... can I "
"5044",5044,"		bring him this blanket?"
"5045",5045,"	The Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA "
"5046",5046,"	FOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway. Guard "
"5047",5047,"	moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor."

"5050",5050," ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE"
"5051",5051,"	A narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of "
"5052",5052,"	shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered "

"5054",5054,"	reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance "
"5055",5055,"	into the room."
"5056",5056,"	The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this "
"5057",5057,"	corridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed "

"5066",5066,"	There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which "
"5067",5067,"	Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality "

"5069",5069,"	The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees. "
"5070",5070,"	Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding "
"5071",5071,"	it. His face, although without makeup and without the "
"5072",5072,"	surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity "
"5073",5073,"	about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch "

"5075",5075,"	Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if "
