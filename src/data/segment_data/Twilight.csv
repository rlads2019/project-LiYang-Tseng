3839,3839,          Deputies come and go in the background. Bella approaches 
3840,3840,          Charlie. He looks up.

3852,3852,          And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. A beat..

3855,3855,          
3856,3856,          Then Charlie squeezes her hand. It's the first physical
3857,3857,          affection we've seen between them. And it threatens to evoke
3858,3858,"          even more emotion in Charlie. So he tamps it down, and rises, "

6066,6066,          catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward 
6067,6067,          and Emmett take positions in the outfield.

6093,6093,          Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.

6102,6102,          and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous 
6103,6103,          boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe!

6148,6148,

6162,6162,"          There's a faint rustle... then James, Victoria and Laurent"
6163,6163,"          emerge. As they near, Bella SEES their bare feet, then the "
6164,6164,          deep BURGUNDY of their eyes. Laurent holds up the baseball.

6172,6172,          to Dr. Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely.
