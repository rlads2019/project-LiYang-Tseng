67,67,               THE BOYS AROUND HIM

71,71,                         Pushes through the men.  Puts himself
72,72,                         in front of DeLancey.
73,73,               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far
74,74,"               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,"

77,77,               helmet and lights the cigar.
78,78,               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
79,79,               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
80,80,               terrified.

88,88,               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
89,89,               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the
90,90,               cheek and moves on to the bow.
91,91,                                     MILLER

94,94,               PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND
95,95,"               It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none"
96,96,               of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it
97,97,               belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his
98,98,               eyes back to the objective.

146,146,               Roughly yanks him up.  Nearly choking him.  They boy climbs

223,223,                         Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller
224,224,                         exchange a look.  They both see the
225,225,                         madness of what they're doing.
226,226,               MILLER AND THE OTHERS
227,227,               OPEN UP on the Germans.
228,228,                                     MILLER
229,229,                         GO!

234,234,                                     IN THE GAP
235,235,                         BULLETS EVERYWHERE.
236,236,               Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce
237,237,               down.  EXPLODE below.
238,238,               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller
239,239,               sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT 
240,240, THE OPEN.
241,241,               A perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING
242,242,               TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.
243,243,               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER
244,244,               SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He
245,245,"               swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward"
246,246,               Miller.
247,247,               A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant
248,248,               from death.
249,249,               SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE
250,250,               Under the overhang to safety.
251,251,"               MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL"
252,252,               IS BLOWN OFF.

256,256,               Sarge hollers back to Miller.

262,262,               Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.
263,263,               HIT more Germans.
264,264,"               SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop"
265,265,               near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw
266,266,"               long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed."
267,267,               THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.
268,268,               Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.
269,269,                                     MILLER
270,270,                         Crosses the gap.  His men follow.
271,271,                                     AT THE CREST
272,272,                         The Americans swarm over the top.
273,273,                         FIRING.
274,274,               TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.
275,275,               Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans
276,276,               are CUT DOWN.
277,277,"               MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man"
278,278,               who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel

280,280,                                     MILLER
281,281,"                         Okay, Wade, your turn."
282,282,"               Wade Captain, I love it when you say that."

284,284,               the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.
285,285,"               Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED"

299,299,"               Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff"
300,300,"               at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering"
301,301,               the rocks and the beach below.  He's clearly affected.
302,302,               Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves
303,303,"               on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German"
304,304,               bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE

362,362,               The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear
363,363,               and freeze.

397,397,               She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the

1016,1016,                                     MILLER
1017,1017,"                         Now we've got a straight shot, due"

1020,1020,"                         St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take"
1021,1021,"                         the jeep as far as we can, then go"
1022,1022,                         on on foot.
1023,1023,                                     SARGE
1024,1024,                         We in radio contact with anybody up
1025,1025,                         there?
1026,1026,                                     MILLER
1027,1027,                         Somebody put the wrong crystals in
1028,1028,                         every one of the Hundred-and-First's
1029,1029,"                         radios the night before the drop,"
1030,1030,                         not one of them works.  We're going
1031,1031,                         in blind.
1032,1032,                                     REIBEN
1033,1033,                         I usually like surprises.
1034,1034,                                     SARGE
1035,1035,                         What are we likely to run into?
1036,1036,                                     MILLER
1037,1037,"                         A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut"
1038,1038,"                         divisions, no fronts, no lines, the"
1039,1039,"                         drops were completely fouled up,"
1040,1040,                         we've got little pockets of
1041,1041,"                         paratroopers all over the place,"
1042,1042,                         trying to hang on.  Command says we
1043,1043,"                         hold St. Mere, but north of that,"
1044,1044,                         it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's
1045,1045,"                         where he's supposed to be, he's more"
1046,1046,                         than likely dead.
1047,1047,                                     SARGE
1048,1048,                         Hell of a mission.
1049,1049,                                     MILLER
1050,1050,"                         Yep, hell of a mission."
1051,1051,               IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP
1052,1052,               Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring
1053,1053,"               at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful"
1054,1054,               smile.
1055,1055,"               Upham Hi.  So, uh, you're all Rangers?"
1056,1056,"               Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an"
1057,1057,               insect.
1058,1058,               Upham I'm Upham.
1059,1059,               (pointing at his corporal's stripes)
1060,1060,"               Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat."
1061,1061,               Their jaws drop.

1063,1063,                              (to Wade)
1064,1064,"                         You want to shoot him, or should I?"
1065,1065,               Wade It's not my turn.
1066,1066,                                     REIBEN
1067,1067,                              (politely)
1068,1068,                         Jackson?
1069,1069,                                     JACKSON
1070,1070,"                         Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,"
1071,1071,                         Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
1072,1072,               Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.
1073,1073,               Upham Miller?
1074,1074,                                     MILLER
1075,1075,"                         I don't want anybody to shoot him,"
1076,1076,                         that's an order.  He speaks French
1077,1077,                         and his German has a touch of the
1078,1078,                         Bavarian.
1079,1079,"               Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?"
1080,1080,"               Miller sighs, he knows what's coming."
1081,1081,                                     UPHAM
1082,1082,                              (continuing)

1084,1084,                         of Hon...?
1085,1085,               Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances
1086,1086,               of Miller's men.  Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-
1087,1087,               faced.
1088,1088,"               No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as"

1093,1093,                         me.
1094,1094,                                     MILLER
1095,1095,"                         Yeah, how so?"

1099,1099,                         of the greatest composers ever lived
1100,1100,"                         and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean,"
1101,1101,"                         who'd he piss off?  And here I am,"
1102,1102,                         the Beethoven of ladies foundation
1103,1103,"                         garments, one step away from Caen,"

1106,1106,                         Ramelle to save some fucking private
1107,1107,                         who's probably already dead.
1108,1108,                                     MILLER
1109,1109,"                         There's to be a bright side, look"
1110,1110,                         for it.

1113,1113,                         for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company
1114,1114,                         is going to Caen and we're going to
1115,1115,                         the goddamned cheese capital of
1116,1116,                         France.  There is no bright side.
1117,1117,                                     MILLER
1118,1118,                         There's always a bright side.
1119,1119,                                     REIBEN
1120,1120,"                         I'm listening, sir."

1127,1127,"                         Well, you're a happy idiot."
1128,1128,               THEY ROUND A TURN
1129,1129,               SKID TO A STOP AT A:
1130,1130,               BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES
1131,1131,               A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him.
1132,1132,                                     MILLER
1133,1133,                         How's the road up to St. Mere?
1134,1134,"               Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding"
1135,1135,"               somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic."
1136,1136,                                     MILLER
1137,1137,                         Anybody getting through?
1138,1138,               Lieutenant The lucky ones.
1139,1139,"               Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying"
1140,1140,               gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels
1141,1141,"               down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters."
1142,1142,               They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct
1143,1143,               hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.
1144,1144,               AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS
1145,1145,"               On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of"
1146,1146,               a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham
1147,1147,               grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's
1148,1148,               reaction.
1149,1149,                                     IN THE BACK
1150,1150,                         The men bounce up and down like

1152,1152,                         not be thrown out.
1153,1153,                                     REIBEN
1154,1154,"                         Hell, this is better than Coney"
1155,1155,                         Island!
1156,1156,                                     A HUGE BUMP
1157,1157,                         Bounces Reiben up and slams his back
1158,1158,                         down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN
1159,1159,                         PAIN.
1160,1160,                                     MILLER
1161,1161,                         Just trying to make room for Ryan.
1162,1162,"               Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his"
1163,1163,               shovel from under his bruised ass.
1164,1164,               THEY ROUND A BEND
1165,1165,"               See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning,"
1166,1166,               obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run.
1167,1167,               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN
1168,1168,               Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER
1169,1169,                                     MILLER
1170,1170,                              (sweetly)
1171,1171,                         Sarge?
1172,1172,               SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on.
1173,1173,                                     ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES
1174,1174,                         Thirty yards ahead of them.
1175,1175,                                     MILLER
1176,1176,                         Directs Sarge off the road.
1177,1177,                                     MILLER
1178,1178,                         They've got the road zeroed.
1179,1179,                                     SARGE
1180,1180,"                         Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep"
1181,1181,                         off the road.
1182,1182,                                     THE JEEP BOUNCES
1183,1183,                         Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing
1184,1184,                         everyone out.  Somehow they hang on.
1185,1185,                         The jeep tears along the rutted field.
1186,1186,                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
1187,1187,                         Just behind them.
1188,1188,                                     SARGE DRIVES MADLY
1189,1189,                         Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid
1190,1190,                         the biggest ruts and bumps.
1191,1191,                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
1192,1192,                         Close on their side.  Showers them
1193,1193,                         with debris.
1194,1194,                                     SARGE
1195,1195,                         Jesus Christ!
1196,1196,               MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN
1197,1197,               Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.

1218,1218,                         first to regain his bearings.  Jumps
1219,1219,                         up.  Checks out the jeep.  Undamaged.

1225,1225,               The wheels spin.  Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.

1311,1311,               THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES
1312,1312,               Keep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards

1593,1593,                         But not for Granddad.  He just
1594,1594,                         convinced himself he was on a cruise

1619,1619,                         complaining.
1620,1620,"               Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a"

1633,1633,                         Martha fart through a field-phone.
1634,1634,               The men are stunned.

1636,1636,"                         Jesus Christ, he's a natural!"
1637,1637,                                     MILLER
1638,1638,"                         Upham, are you sure you've never"
1639,1639,                         been in combat?
1640,1640,"               Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain"
1641,1641,               I'd remember.
1642,1642,               Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.
1643,1643,                                     MILLER
1644,1644,                         He's good.
1645,1645,               They walk on.

1648,1648,"               Miller smiles, situation normal."
1649,1649,               
1650,1650, ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON
1651,1651,               A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active
1652,1652,               battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR
1653,1653,               EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers
1654,1654,"               crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans."
1655,1655,               Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a

1657,1657,               and disappear into the remains of a building.
1658,1658,               Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a
1659,1659,"               corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread"
1660,1660,               out down the block behind him.
1661,1661,"               Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental"
1662,1662,               picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of
1663,1663,               an alley across the street and down the block.  They are

1665,1665,"               As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET"
1666,1666,               SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.
1667,1667,               Miller motions Jackson across first.
1668,1668,                                     MILLER
1669,1669,                         Stay low.
1670,1670,"               Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,"
1671,1671,               kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and
1672,1672,               makes it to the cover of the far side.
1673,1673,                                     JACKSON
1674,1674,                         Dang!  That was close!
1675,1675,               Miller nods to Upham.
1676,1676,                                     MILLER
1677,1677,                         Your turn.
1678,1678,"               Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him"
1679,1679,               very gently.
1680,1680,                                     MILLER
1681,1681,"                         Zig-zag, change your pace a couple"
1682,1682,"                         times, you'll be alright."
1683,1683,               Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.
1684,1684,                                     MILLER
1685,1685,"                         Okay, I'm going to draw fire for"
1686,1686,                         you.
1687,1687,                              (sternly)
1688,1688,"                         But if I do, you goddamned well better"
1689,1689,                         go.
1690,1690,"               Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath."
1691,1691,               CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.
1692,1692,                                     MILLER
1693,1693,                         Looks to Upham
1694,1694,                                     MILLER
1695,1695,                         Ready?
1696,1696,"               Upham nods, still terrified."
1697,1697,               MILLER STEPS 
1698,1698, THE OPEN
1699,1699,"               Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers."
1700,1700,                                     MILLER
1701,1701,                         Go.
1702,1702,               Upham runs.
1703,1703,               A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.
1704,1704,               He doesn't budge.
1705,1705,"               UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast."
1706,1706,               REIBEN watches Upham run.
1707,1707,                                     REIBEN
1708,1708,"                         Hey, that guy can move."
1709,1709,               A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to
1710,1710,               the far side.
1711,1711,               MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't
1712,1712,               even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.
1713,1713,"               He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent."
1714,1714,                                     SARGE
1715,1715,                              (under his breath so
1716,1716,                              only Miller can hear)
1717,1717,                         Damn fool.
1718,1718,                              (beat)

1724,1724,                              speaks to Reiben)
1725,1725,                         Glad of it.
1726,1726,                                     UPHAM
1727,1727,"                         On the other side of the street,"
1728,1728,                         crouches in a doorway with Jackson.

1731,1731,                         from what Miller just did for him.
1732,1732,                                     MILLER
1733,1733,                         DASHES across the street.
1734,1734,"               GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches"
1735,1735,               behind him.
1736,1736,               HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.
1737,1737,                                     MILLER
1738,1738,                         Bring 'em over.
1739,1739,"               UPHAM, tries to thank Miller."

1742,1742,"               Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade."

1744,1744,                         One at a time.
1745,1745,                                     MILLER

1747,1747,                         runs down the block.  He passes a:
1748,1748,                                     BOMBED OUT BUILDING
1749,1749,                         Out of the line of fire.  A dozen
1750,1750,                         dead American soldiers lined up on
1751,1751,"                         the ground.  The battered, bloody"
1752,1752,"                         bodies, only partially covered by"
1753,1753,                         ponchos.
1754,1754,               Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.
1755,1755,               Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.
1756,1756,                                     MILLER
1757,1757,"                         Sees the dead and wounded, shows no"
1758,1758,                         reaction.  Runs to:
1759,1759,                                     AN ALLEY
1760,1760,                         Captain Hamill and his men are bunched
1761,1761,"                         there, out of the line of fire."
1762,1762,                         He's sending off a squad to continue
1763,1763,                         their door-to-door.
1764,1764,"               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the"
1765,1765,"               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go."
1766,1766,               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two
1767,1767,"               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak"
1768,1768,               familiarly.
1769,1769,               Captain hamill How was the road in?
1770,1770,                                     MILLER
1771,1771,"                         We had a jeep until a few hours ago,"
1772,1772,"                         a nice one, it had a cute little"
1773,1773,                         flag with a couple of stars on it.
1774,1774,"               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame."
1775,1775,"               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley."
1776,1776,                                     MILLER
1777,1777,                         We called in a strike on the eighty-
1778,1778,"                         eights that took it out, but it's"
1779,1779,"                         the Kraut spotter that counts,"
1780,1780,                         wherever the hell that bastard is.
1781,1781,               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
1782,1782,               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.
1783,1783,               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying
1784,1784,               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying
1785,1785,               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant
1786,1786,               steeple.
1787,1787,                                     MILLER
1788,1788,                         Jackson.
1789,1789,               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson
1790,1790,               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and
1791,1791,"               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to"
1792,1792,               his back.
1793,1793,"               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and"
1794,1794,               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
1795,1795,"               unusual, long-barrel, rifle."
1796,1796,"               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,"
1797,1797,"               along with Upham, watch curiously."
1798,1798,"               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,"
1799,1799,               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he
1800,1800,               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He
1801,1801,               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham
1802,1802,               is fascinated.
1803,1803,                                     UPHAM
1804,1804,                         What is that?
1805,1805,"               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized"
1806,1806,               shell.
1807,1807,                                     JACKSON
1808,1808,"                         Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel"
1809,1809,"                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,"
1810,1810,                         elevated three-glass scope and a
1811,1811,                         single-throw hammer.
1812,1812,                                     UPHAM
1813,1813,                         The Army gave you that?
1814,1814,                                     JACKSON
1815,1815,                         Yep.
1816,1816,                                     UPHAM
1817,1817,                         You must be a hell a shot.
1818,1818,                                     JACKSON
1819,1819,                         Not where I come from.
1820,1820,               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
1821,1821,               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.
1822,1822,               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the
1823,1823,"               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight"
1824,1824,"               and waits, absolutely motionless."
1825,1825,                                     UPHAM
1826,1826,                         That must be four thousand yards.
1827,1827,                                     JACKSON
1828,1828,                              (without taking his
1829,1829,                              eye from the scope)
1830,1830,"                         Forty-two-hundred, I figure."
1831,1831,                                     UPHAM
1832,1832,                         You take account of the wind?
1833,1833,               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
1834,1834,"               back with an expression that clearly says, \""What are you,"
1835,1835,"               some kind of fucking idiot?\"" Reiben puts himself between"
1836,1836,               Upham and Jackson.
1837,1837,                                     REIBEN
1838,1838,                              (put-on Southern accent)
1839,1839,"                         Dang right, he take 'count of the"
1840,1840,"                         wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a"
1841,1841,                         Kentucky windage?
1842,1842,               Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the
1843,1843,               trigger.
1844,1844,                                     JACKSON
1845,1845,"                         Reiben, how many time I got to tell"
1846,1846,"                         you, I'm from Tennessee."
1847,1847,                                     REIBEN
1848,1848,"                         They got squirrels there, too, right?"
1849,1849,               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart
1850,1850,               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
1851,1851,"               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them"
1852,1852,               the St. Mere road is open.
1853,1853,               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to
1854,1854,               Miller.
1855,1855,               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?
1856,1856,                                     MILLER
1857,1857,"                         Very far, they're not coming this"
1858,1858,"                         way, they're going to take Caen first."
1859,1859,"               Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a"
1860,1860,"               lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it"
1861,1861,               gets better.  How many men did you bring?
1862,1862,                                     MILLER
1863,1863,"                         Five, but we not staying, we're on"
1864,1864,                         our way to Ramelle.
1865,1865,"               Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private"
1866,1866,               Ryan?
1867,1867,                                     MILLER
1868,1868,"                         Yeah, you know about that?"
1869,1869,"               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in"
1870,1870,               with the early wounded or dead.
1871,1871,"               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED"
1872,1872,"               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan."
1873,1873,"               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted"
1874,1874,               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two
1875,1875,"               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,"
1876,1876,               they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.
1877,1877,                                     MILLER
1878,1878,                         Wonderful.
1879,1879,"               Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the"
1880,1880,               hell out of there before those Krauts show up.
1881,1881,                                     MILLER
1882,1882,                         How do we get out of here?
1883,1883,"               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in"
1884,1884,               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If
1885,1885,"               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,"
1886,1886,               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
1887,1887,               tomorrow night.
1888,1888,               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his
1889,1889,               head.
1890,1890,"               Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?"
1891,1891,               Miller shrugs.
1892,1892,"               Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but"
1893,1893,               I understand what you're doing?
1894,1894,                                     MILLER
1895,1895,                         Yeah?
1896,1896,               Captain hamill Good luck.
1897,1897,                                     MILLER
1898,1898,                         Thanks.
1899,1899,               Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.
1900,1900,               Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful
1901,1901,               sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.
1902,1902,                                     MILLER
1903,1903,                         Let's find someplace to hole up.
1904,1904,"               Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head"
1905,1905,"               of the alley, Miller passes Upham."
1906,1906,                                     UPHAM
1907,1907,"                         Sir, I'm sorry about what happened,"
1908,1908,                         I...
1909,1909,                                     MILLER
1910,1910,                              (interrupting)
1911,1911,                         It was nothing.
1912,1912,                                     UPHAM
1913,1913,                         But you could have gotten killed and
1914,1914,                         I...
1915,1915,                                     MILLER
1916,1916,                              (interrupting)
1917,1917,"                         Like I said, it was nothing."
1918,1918,                              (to the men)
1919,1919,                         Don't bunch up.
1920,1920,"               He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham"
1921,1921,               watches him go.
1922,1922,                                     UPHAM
1923,1923,"                         Did you see what he did, back there?"
1924,1924,"                         He stepped right into the open, so I"
1925,1925,                         could get across.
1926,1926,                                     JACKSON
1927,1927,"                         Shit, that was no big deal."
1928,1928,                                     WADE
1929,1929,                         They can't kill him.

1931,1931,                         Like hell they can't.

2130,2130,               The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets
2131,2131,               serious.

2148,2148,               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in
2149,2149,               Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.

2219,2219, ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
2220,2220,               Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill
2221,2221,               and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:
2222,2222,               A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON
2223,2223,               Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The
2224,2224,               AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the
2225,2225,               countryside like a tidal wave.
2226,2226,"               Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL."

2230,2230,               Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.
2231,2231,               MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.
2232,2232,"               SARGE notices, says nothing."
2233,2233,"               MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes"
2234,2234,               go back to the BLAZING SKY.

2239,2239,                         It doesn't take this.
2240,2240,               Upham's face shows more fear than awe.

2242,2242,                         I wasn't made for this.

2246,2246,               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns
2247,2247,               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a
2248,2248,               hold of himself and speaks gently.
2249,2249,                                     MILLER

2253,2253,               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for
2254,2254,"               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off."
2255,2255,                                     MILLER

2258,2258,               Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points
2259,2259,               the way.

2265,2265,"               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up"
2266,2266,               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to
2267,2267,               Reiben.
2268,2268,               Gentle-faced private Here.
2269,2269,               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-

2271,2271,               vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.

2273,2273,               Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.
2274,2274,               Reiben takes the ammo.

2278,2278,"               Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands"
2279,2279,               them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.
2280,2280,                                     MILLER

2282,2282,"                         than us, or Ryan."
2283,2283,               Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes
2284,2284,               the ammo back.

2288,2288,               lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill

2294,2294,               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way
2295,2295,               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside
2296,2296,               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.

2499,2499,                                     MILLER
2500,2500,                         They don't send planes to put out
2501,2501,                         machine guns.
2502,2502,                              (beat)
2503,2503,                         Two flank runners with surpressing
2504,2504,"                         fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes"
2505,2505,                         left has to be fast.
2506,2506,               Upham steels himself and steps forward.
2507,2507,                                     UPHAM
2508,2508,"                         Sir, I ran the 220 in high school."
2509,2509,                                     REIBEN
2510,2510,"                         He's fast, Captain, I saw him."
2511,2511,               Miller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer.
2512,2512,                                     WADE
2513,2513,                         How fast?
2514,2514,                                     UPHAM
2515,2515,                         Twenty-four-five.
2516,2516,                                     WADE
2517,2517,"                         Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty-"
2518,2518,                         two flat.
2519,2519,                                     MILLER
2520,2520,                         Wade goes left.
2521,2521,               Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is
2522,2522,               impressed.
2523,2523,                                     UPHAM
2524,2524,                         Twenty-two flat?
2525,2525,               Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.
2526,2526,                                     WADE
2527,2527,                         I would have won the states if some
2528,2528,                         bastard hadn't tripped me in the
2529,2529,                         finals.
2530,2530,               Miller points the others to their firing positions.
2531,2531,                                     MILLER
2532,2532,"                         Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben,"
2533,2533,"                         ten yards, either side."
2534,2534,"               As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,"
2535,2535,               out of earshot of the men.
2536,2536,                                     SARGE
2537,2537,"                         Rule of thumb, Captain, says you"
2538,2538,"                         ought to detail this one, instead of"
2539,2539,                         going yourself.
2540,2540,               Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.
2541,2541,                                     MILLER
2542,2542,                         Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
2543,2543,                                     SARGE
2544,2544,"                         How about I go right, sir?"
2545,2545,                                     MILLER
2546,2546,                         How about you take your position?
2547,2547,               Sarge hesitates.
2548,2548,                                     SARGE
2549,2549,                         How about...?
2550,2550,                                     MILLER
2551,2551,                              (interrupting)
2552,2552,                         How about you shut up and take your
2553,2553,                         position?
2554,2554,               Sarge nods.
2555,2555,                                     SARGE
2556,2556,"                         Yes, sir."
2557,2557,               Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near
2558,2558,               Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.
2559,2559,                                     UPHAM
2560,2560,"                         Good luck, Captain."
2561,2561,                                     MILLER
2562,2562,"                         Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got"
2563,2563,                         five lives.
2564,2564,                                     UPHAM
2565,2565,"                         The men said, nine."
2566,2566,                                     MILLER
2567,2567,                         What do they know?
2568,2568,                              (beat)
2569,2569,"                         I had nine, but I feel through the"
2570,2570,"                         ice when I was seven, my brother"
2571,2571,                         pulled me out.  Then I used one when
2572,2572,                         a grenade landed in my foxhole in
2573,2573,"                         Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one"
2574,2574,"                         on the beaches, one on the cliffs"
2575,2575,                         and two getting here.
2576,2576,                                     UPHAM
2577,2577,                         That only leaves three.
2578,2578,                                     MILLER
2579,2579,                         Plenty.
2580,2580,               Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade.
2581,2581,                                     MILLER
2582,2582,                         Ready?
2583,2583,                                     WADE
2584,2584,"                         Yes, sir."
2585,2585,               Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now.
2586,2586,               MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.
2587,2587,               Onto opposite sides of the field.  Nothing happens for a
2588,2588,               moment.  Then:
2589,2589,               A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.  MURDEROUSLY LOUD.
2590,2590,               SHATTERING THE QUIET.
2591,2591,                                     IN THE NEST
2592,2592,"                         A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING"
2593,2593,"                         THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE"
2594,2594,"                         8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon."
2595,2595,"                         Four Germans in the nest, four more"
2596,2596,                         outlying riflemen.
2597,2597,                                     MILLER
2598,2598,                         Takes the FIRST FIRE.  He HITS THE
2599,2599,                         DIRT.  The BULLETS SCREAM just over
2600,2600,                         him.
2601,2601,               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPR
2602,2602,               WADE HITS THE DIRT
2603,2603,               The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.
2604,2604,"               SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM"
2605,2605,               Zero the machine gun.  FIRE fast as they can.  Their BULLETS
2606,2606,               THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.
2607,2607,               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND
2608,2608,               SPR
2609,2609, MILLER HITS THE DIRT
2610,2610,               Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.
2611,2611,                                     SARGE
2612,2612,                         FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.
2613,2613,                         No effect.  Pissed.  POPS THE CLIP.
2614,2614,                         SLAMS in another.  FIRES.
2615,2615,               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER
2616,2616,               He rises and runs.  Fast.  Almost to the far hedgerow.
2617,2617,                                     WADE
2618,2618,                         Ten more yards.  Too slow.  A deadly
2619,2619,                         row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward
2620,2620,                         him.
2621,2621,                                     MILLER
2622,2622,                         Makes it to the far side.  Scrambles
2623,2623,                         up the roots.  Dives through the
2624,2624,                         brush.
2625,2625,                                     WADE
2626,2626,                         On a slight rise.  Can't hit the
2627,2627,                         dirt.  A line of bullets.  Desperately
2628,2628,                         sprints.
2629,2629,               WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.
2630,2630,               Goes down.
2631,2631,"               SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified.  FIRE at the nest."
2632,2632,                                     MILLER
2633,2633,                         STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.
2634,2634,                         Stumbles onto the path.  Rolls to
2635,2635,"                         his feet, running.  Swings his"
2636,2636,                         Thompson into firing position.  Racing
2637,2637,                         toward the nest.
2638,2638,               SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.
2639,2639,                                     MILLER
2640,2640,                         Tearing along the path.  Sees a German
2641,2641,                         rifleman.  FIRES A BURST.  CUTS HIM
2642,2642,                         DOWN.  Runs over the body without
2643,2643,                         breaking stride.
2644,2644,               SARGE STEPS 
2645,2645," THE OPEN, "
2646,2646,NTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN
2647,2647,               FIRE from Miller.
2648,2648,               The GERMANS ZERO SARGE.  BULLETS THUD all around him.  Somehow
2649,2649,               he's not hit.
2650,2650,                                     MILLER
2651,2651,                         TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.  BLASTS his
2652,2652,                         Thompson.  CUTS DOWN two more German
2653,2653,                         riflemen.  Grabs a grenade.  Pulls
2654,2654,                         the pin.
2655,2655,                                     THE NEST
2656,2656,                         The Germans see Miller coming.  Wheel
2657,2657,                         from Sarge.  Too late.
2658,2658,                                     MILLER
2659,2659,"                         THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES."
2660,2660,               THE GRENADE EXPLODES.  The four Germans in the nest are
2661,2661,               KILLED.
2662,2662,               SARGE hollers to the others.
2663,2663,                                     SARGE
2664,2664,                         HOLD YOUR FIRE!
2665,2665,                                     MILLER
2666,2666,                         Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another
2667,2667,                         BURST.  KILLS the last of the German
2668,2668,                         riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto
2669,2669,                         the field.
2670,2670,               SARGE AND THE OTHERS
2671,2671,               See Miller running toward Wade.  They instantly RACE onto
2672,2672,               the field.
2673,2673,                                     WADE
2674,2674,                         Lies in the grass.  Holding his belly.
2675,2675,                         Astonished by the pain.
2676,2676,               ALL THE AMERICANS RUN

2678,2678,               down.

2682,2682,                         Stop instantly.  Turn toward the
2683,2683,                         perimeter of the field.
2684,2684,                                     SARGE
2685,2685,                         Roots through his medical kit as he
2686,2686,                         runs.  Dropping and scattering
2687,2687,                         inessentials behind him.
2688,2688,                                     WADE
2689,2689,                         Wide-eyed.  Not even writhing.  Too
2690,2690,                         much pain.
2691,2691,               MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE
2692,2692,               Throw themselves onto the ground next to him.  They both
2693,2693,               tear out sulfa-packs.  Sarge frantically fumbles.  Ripping
2694,2694,               one open.  Powder spills.
2695,2695,               REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.
2696,2696,                                     SARGE
2697,2697,                         Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.
2698,2698,                         Pours sulfa powder.
2699,2699,                                     MILLER
2700,2700,                         About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the
2701,2701,                         wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
2702,2702,                                     MILLER
2703,2703,                         Damn it!
2704,2704,               Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.
2705,2705,                                     SARGE
2706,2706,                         Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.
2707,2707,                                     SARGE
2708,2708,"                         Sulfa, more sulfa..."
2709,2709,                                     WADE
2710,2710,                         Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller.
2711,2711,                         Sees him preparing the morphine shot.
2712,2712,                         They both know.
2713,2713,                                     WADE
2714,2714,                         Yeah...morphine...make it a
2715,2715,                         double...huh...Captain...?
2716,2716,                                     MILLER
2717,2717,                         SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.
2718,2718,                         Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine
2719,2719,                         straight to Wade's brain.  Motions
2720,2720,                         impatiently to Sarge.
2721,2721,                                     MILLER
2722,2722,"                         More morphine, hurry up, come on,"
2723,2723,                         come on...
2724,2724,                                     SARGE
2725,2725,                         Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa.
2726,2726,                         Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the
2727,2727,                         morphine.
2728,2728,                                     MILLER
2729,2729,                         Snatches the morphine from Sarge.
2730,2730,                         Quickly and efficiently prepares a
2731,2731,                         second shot.  He's done this before.
2732,2732,                                     REIBEN
2733,2733,"                         On guard, glancing back.  Pissed"
2734,2734,                         off.
2735,2735,                                     REIBEN
2736,2736,                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
2737,2737,                         it...
2738,2738,                                     UPHAM
2739,2739,                         Freaked out.  Trying to keep his
2740,2740,                         eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
2741,2741,                                     JACKSON
2742,2742,                         Watching.
2743,2743,                                     MILLER
2744,2744,                         Gives Wade the second shot.
2745,2745,                                     WADE
2746,2746,                         Feels the effects of the first shot.
2747,2747,                         He sees Upham and manages a pained
2748,2748,                         smile.
2749,2749,"               WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,"
2750,2750,               without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE
2751,2751,               DIES
2752,2752,               ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE
2753,2753,               UPHAM begins to weep.
2754,2754,               REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:
2755,2755,                                     REIBEN
2756,2756,                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
2757,2757,                         it...
2758,2758,                                     MILLER
2759,2759,                         Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently
2760,2760,                         closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers
2761,2761,                         slightly as he unclips one of Wades
2762,2762,                         dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.
2763,2763,                         Sarge notices.
2764,2764,               Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men
2765,2765,               see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.
2766,2766,"               Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,"
2767,2767,               rises and picks up his Thompson.
2768,2768,               Upham shakes his head.
2769,2769,                                     UPHAM
2770,2770,                         That was no twenty-two flat.
2771,2771,               Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.
2772,2772,                                     MILLER
2773,2773,                         He lied.  Let's move out.
2774,2774,               Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men
2775,2775,"               hesitate, then slowly follow him."

2785,2785,"                         Shut up, will you?"

2788,2788,                         up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned
2789,2789,"                         Ryan, fuck the little bastard."
2790,2790,                                     JACKSON

2793,2793,                         The hell he didn't.
2794,2794,               Miller motions to them curtly.
2795,2795,                                     MILLER
2796,2796,                         Keep it down.
2797,2797,"               They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,"
2798,2798,               the men don't hear.
2799,2799,                                     MILLER
2800,2800,                         We've got to find someplace to hole
2801,2801,                         up for a bit.
2802,2802,               Sarge looks at Miller closely.
2803,2803,                                     SARGE
2804,2804,                         You alright?
2805,2805,                                     MILLER
2806,2806,                         Let's just find someplace.

2808,2808, NARROW GULLY - DAY
2809,2809,               Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good
2810,2810,               hiding place.
2811,2811,                                     MILLER
2812,2812,"                         Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,"
2813,2813,                         perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.
2814,2814,                         I'm going to re-con.
2815,2815,"               Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but"
2816,2816,               there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.
2817,2817,               He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.
2818,2818,               
2819,2819, SMALL CLEARING - DAY
2820,2820,"               Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The"
2821,2821,"               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,"
2822,2822,"               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for"
2823,2823,"               faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,"
2824,2824,"               as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,"
2825,2825,               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller
2826,2826,"               senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a"
2827,2827,               thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.
2828,2828,                                     MILLER
2829,2829,                         What was the name of that kid at
2830,2830,"                         Anzio, the one who got his face burned"
2831,2831,                         off?
2832,2832,                                     SARGE
2833,2833,                         Vecchio.
2834,2834,                                     MILLER
2835,2835,"                         Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember"
2836,2836,"                         his name, he was a good kid, remember"
2837,2837,                         how he used to walk on his hands and
2838,2838,                         sing that song about the man on flying
2839,2839,                         trapeze?
2840,2840,                                     SARGE
2841,2841,                         Yeah.
2842,2842,                                     MILLER
2843,2843,                         You know why I'm such a good officer?
2844,2844,                         Because of my mother.  Have I ever
2845,2845,                         told you about her?
2846,2846,                                     SARGE
2847,2847,                         Bits and pieces.
2848,2848,                                     MILLER
2849,2849,                         She's the best poker player you ever
2850,2850,                         saw.  My father used to go to these
2851,2851,                         Saturday night games and lose his
2852,2852,"                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him"
2853,2853,"                         an ultimatum, either she gets a"
2854,2854,                         regular seat at the table or she
2855,2855,                         locks him in every Saturday night.
2856,2856,                         He squawked and so did his buddies
2857,2857,                         but after a while they gave in and
2858,2858,"                         from the first night she sat down,"
2859,2859,                         she never lost.  She could read those
2860,2860,                         cocky bastards like they were playing
2861,2861,                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
2862,2862,                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her

2864,2864,"                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped"
2865,2865,"                         her coffee, she was a master.  She"

3051,3051,"                         I've given this a lot of thought,"
3052,3052,                         sir.  The best thing that could happen
3053,3053,"                         is, we find Ryan and he's dead."
3054,3054,                                     MILLER
3055,3055,                         Why's that?
3056,3056,                                     REIBEN
3057,3057,"                         Well, sir, consider the possibilities."
3058,3058,                         A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take
3059,3059,"                         him back to the beach.  Knowing you,"
3060,3060,"                         you don't let him carry my gear,"
3061,3061,"                         even though he really should, and we"
3062,3062,"                         all get killed, trying to keep him"
3063,3063,                         alive.
3064,3064,                                     MILLER
3065,3065,"                         Except for the last part, that one's"
3066,3066,                         not bad.
3067,3067,                                     REIBEN
3068,3068,                         B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown
3069,3069,"                         up by the German equivalent of Wade,"
3070,3070,                         whose name I know you don't want me
3071,3071,                         to mention.  There's nothing to find.
3072,3072,                         The biggest piece is the size of a
3073,3073,"                         pea.  We wander around, looking for"
3074,3074,"                         him until the Germans pick us off,"
3075,3075,                         one after another.
3076,3076,                                     MILLER
3077,3077,                         I don't like that one.

3079,3079,"                         Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is"
3080,3080,"                         the worst one, we find Ryan and he's"
3081,3081,                         wounded.  Not only does he not carry
3082,3082,"                         my gear, we have to carry his gear."
3083,3083,                         And him.
3084,3084,                                     MILLER
3085,3085,                         But we accomplish the mission.
3086,3086,                                     REIBEN
3087,3087,                         Maybe.  But what if he dies on the
3088,3088,"                         way back?  you see what I'm saying,"
3089,3089,                         sir?  The best possible situation
3090,3090,"                         is, he's dead, we find his body,"
3091,3091,"                         more or less intact, we grab one of"
3092,3092,                         his dog-tags and high-tail it back
3093,3093,"                         to the beach, or better yet, we head"
3094,3094,                         over to Caen and catch up with
3095,3095,                         division.
3096,3096,                                     MILLER
3097,3097,"                         Has anyone ever told you, you're"
3098,3098,                         officer material?
3099,3099,                                     REIBEN
3100,3100,"                         No, sir."
3101,3101,                                     MILLER
3102,3102,                         That's a mystery to me.
3103,3103,"               No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less."

3105,3105, CROSSROADS - DAY
3106,3106,               The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush
3107,3107,"               near the crossroads.  A sign reads:  \""Ramelle 3 Km.\""  Miller"
3108,3108,               folds up the map.

3110,3110,                         Looks like we're going to beat those
3111,3111,                         Kraut companies to Ramelle.
3112,3112,"               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something"
3113,3113,"               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they"
3114,3114,               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.
3115,3115,                                     MILLER
3116,3116,                         I don't think so.

3118,3118, FRENCH ROAD - DAY
3119,3119,               THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop
3120,3120,"               trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack"
3121,3121,               Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a
3122,3122,               bridge.

3124,3124,               Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
3125,3125,               Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.
3126,3126,                                     GERMAN FLANK SQUADS
3127,3127,                         Hurry along the fields on either

3129,3129,                         with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS
3130,3130,                         MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching
3131,3131,                         German Flank Squad.  They flatten
3132,3132,                         themselves into the mucky water.
3133,3133,                         Ready their weapons.  Prepare to
3134,3134,                         fire.
3135,3135,                                     THE GERMAN SQUAD
3136,3136,                         Approaches the bridge.
3137,3137,               PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES
3138,3138,               See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.
3139,3139,                                     MILLER
3140,3140,                         Is just about to open up on them.
3141,3141,                                     THE GERMAN SERGEANT
3142,3142,                         Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind
3143,3143,                         and CALLS to them.
3144,3144,                                     THE GERMAN PRIVATES
3145,3145,                         Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the
3146,3146,                         convoy.
3147,3147,                                     IN THE CULVERT

3152,3152,                         Same place we are.
3153,3153,"               Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast"

3159,3159,               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.
3160,3160,               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the
3161,3161,               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.
3162,3162,               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD
3163,3163,               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

3174,3174,"               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more"
3175,3175,               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER
3176,3176,               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know
3177,3177,"               that sound, they don't like it."
3178,3178,               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS

3181,3181,"               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two"
3182,3182,"               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and"
3183,3183,"               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare."
3184,3184,               There are four of them.

3189,3189,"                         to do so, looking back nervously at"
3190,3190,                         the German tanks.

3200,3200,               the firing.
3201,3201,               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He

3209,3209,               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of
3210,3210,"               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings"
3211,3211,"               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged."
3212,3212,               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on

3238,3238,                                     MILLER
3239,3239,                         You're only allowed to shoot at
3240,3240,"                         Germans, that's one of the rules."
3241,3241,                                     REIBEN
3242,3242,"                         Have it your way, Captain."
3243,3243,"               Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward"
3244,3244,               the bridge.
3245,3245,               THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP
3246,3246,               Bullets SMASH 
3247,3247, THE GROUND around Miller.
3248,3248,                                     MILLER'S MEN
3249,3249,"                         POUR FIRE at the German positions,"
3250,3250,                         SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.
3251,3251,                                     ON THE BRIDGE
3252,3252,                         The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM
3253,3253,                         OF BULLETS at the German positions.
3254,3254,               Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive
3255,3255,"               jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies."
3256,3256,               He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the
3257,3257,               young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are
3258,3258,"               some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller"
3259,3259,"               catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to"
3260,3260,               nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.
3261,3261,                                     MILLER
3262,3262,                         I'll keep it in mind.
3263,3263,                              (calls to Sarge)
3264,3264,"                         OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME."
3265,3265,               Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as
3266,3266,               they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.
3267,3267,"               Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to"
3268,3268,"               hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days."
3269,3269,                                     MILLER
3270,3270,                         Things are tough all over.  We're
3271,3271,                         looking for a Private James Ryan.
3272,3272,               Forrest Ryan?
3273,3273,                                     MILLER
3274,3274,                         Is he here?
3275,3275,               Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.
3276,3276,               Forrest Go get Ryan.
3277,3277,                                     (TO MILLER)
3278,3278,"                         What do you want him for, sir?"
3279,3279,               Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and
3280,3280,               scrambles to them.
3281,3281,                                     MILLER
3282,3282,"                         Jackson, get a hold of command."
3283,3283,               Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to
3284,3284,               Forrest.
3285,3285,                                     MILLER
3286,3286,                         How many men do you have?
3287,3287,"               They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men"
3288,3288,               to leap over the barricade.
3289,3289,"               Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge"
3290,3290,               was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
3291,3291,               ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.
3292,3292,"               Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's"
3293,3293,               hailing I.D.   No response.
3294,3294,                                     JACKSON
3295,3295,                         Not yet.
3296,3296,                                     MILLER
3297,3297,                         Keep trying.
3298,3298,"               Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?"
3299,3299,"               Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:"
3300,3300,                                     PRIVATE JAMES RYAN
3301,3301,"                         Dashing from cover to cover, making"
3302,3302,                         his way toward them.  Ryan is an
3303,3303,"                         American classic, nineteen years"
3304,3304,"                         old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky."
3305,3305,"                         Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and"
3306,3306,"                         smeared with dirt and blood, he's"
3307,3307,"                         very alive.  His eyes shine, his"
3308,3308,                         face has a spark.  You can't help
3309,3309,                         but love this kid.
3310,3310,                                     MILLER'S MEN
3311,3311,                         All watch Ryan run toward them.
3312,3312,                                     JACKSON
3313,3313,"                         So, that's Ryan."
3314,3314,                                     REIBEN
3315,3315,                         Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
3316,3316,               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
3317,3317,               barricade.  He salutes Miller.
3318,3318,                                     REIBEN
3319,3319,"                         I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see"
3320,3320,                         me?
3321,3321,"               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally"
3322,3322,"               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,"
3323,3323,               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.
3324,3324,"               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers"
3325,3325,               have been killed in action.
3326,3326,               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.
3327,3327,               Somehow he remains upright.
3328,3328,               Ryan All three?
3329,3329,                                     MILLER
3330,3330,                         Yes.
3331,3331,"               Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning"
3332,3332,               him against some sandbags.
3333,3333,                                     THE PARATROOPERS
3334,3334,                         Are stunned at the news.  They look
3335,3335,"                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they"
3336,3336,                         can do.
3337,3337,                                     MILLER'S MEN
3338,3338,"                         Also look at Ryan, but then, one"
3339,3339,"                         after another, they turn away,"
3340,3340,"                         adverting their eyes, looking a their"
3341,3341,"                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,"
3342,3342,"                         the sky, anything other than Ryan."
3343,3343,                                     MILLER
3344,3344,                         We've been sent to get you out of
3345,3345,                         here.  You're going home.
3346,3346,               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and
3347,3347,"               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a"
3348,3348,               little room.
3349,3349,"               Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch."
3350,3350,                                     MILLER
3351,3351,"                         Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm"
3352,3352,                         taking you and your men with me.
3353,3353,"               Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this"
3354,3354,               bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-
3355,3355,               ninth Division.
3356,3356,                                     MILLER
3357,3357,"                         I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant."
3358,3358,"               Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command."
3359,3359,                                     MILLER
3360,3360,                         I'm not going to leave you and your
3361,3361,                         men here to get killed.  Get them
3362,3362,"                         together, we're moving out."
3363,3363,"               A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly."
3364,3364,                                     RYAN (O.S.)
3365,3365,"                         No, sir."
3366,3366,               They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about
3367,3367,               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
3368,3368,"               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on"
3369,3369,               the arm and speaks softly to him.
3370,3370,                                     MILLER
3371,3371,"                         Come on, Private, you're going home."
3372,3372,               Ryan jerks away from Miller.
3373,3373,                                     RYAN
3374,3374,"                         No, sir."
3375,3375,               All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.
3376,3376,                                     MILLER
3377,3377,                         Private.  I'm sorry about your
3378,3378,                         brothers but staying here and getting
3379,3379,                         yourself killed isn't going to help.
3380,3380,                                     RYAN
3381,3381,"                         Sir, if the Krauts are holding this"
3382,3382,"                         bridge when division shows up, our"
3383,3383,                         guys are going to be sitting ducks.
3384,3384,                                     MILLER
3385,3385,                         This bridge cannot be held.  The
3386,3386,                         Germans have two companies less than
3387,3387,                         three miles from here.  They have
3388,3388,                         tanks.
3389,3389,"               That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,"
3390,3390,"               but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going."
3391,3391,"               Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger."
3392,3392,                                     MILLER
3393,3393,"                         Private, if you want to commit"
3394,3394,"                         suicide, that's your choice, but"
3395,3395,                         you're going to have to wait until
3396,3396,                         after I get you back to the beach.
3397,3397,                         And you're not going to take these
3398,3398,                         men with you.
3399,3399,               Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.
3400,3400,                                     RYAN
3401,3401,"                         I'm not leaving, sir."
3402,3402,               Miller starts to boil over.
3403,3403,                                     MILLER
3404,3404,"                         The hell you aren't, you're comin'"
3405,3405,                         with me if I have to drag you every
3406,3406,"                         inch of the way.  You hear me,"
3407,3407,                         Private?
3408,3408,                                     RYAN
3409,3409,"                         I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving."
3410,3410,               Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't
3411,3411,               resist.
3412,3412,                                     MILLER
3413,3413,                         Listen you little son-of-a-bitch
3414,3414,                         you're coming with me or
3415,3415,                         I'll...I'll...
3416,3416,               Ryan speaks softly.
3417,3417,                                     RYAN
3418,3418,"                         What are you going to do, sir, shoot"
3419,3419,                         me?
3420,3420,               Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind
3421,3421,               Miller.

4054,4054,                         Doesn't move.  He just stares at

4129,4129,               They all share Reiben's dream for a moment.  Then Jackson

4170,4170,                         all of Addley.  It's not the biggest
4171,4171,"                         house, but it's got the best location,"
4172,4172,                         right next to the junior high baseball
4173,4173,                         field.  The garage windows face left
4174,4174,                         field.  The guy who owned the house
4175,4175,                         before me had these heavy screen S
4176,4176,                         put over them.  The first thing I
4177,4177,                         did when I bought the place was take
4178,4178,                         off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-
4179,4179,                         two yards from home plate to my garage
4180,4180,                         windows.  It takes a hell of a junior
4181,4181,                         high kid to hit a ball that far.  I
4182,4182,                         look at my garage windows as a
4183,4183,                         Motivator and a way to scout the
4184,4184,"                         kids coming up, the ones who are"
4185,4185,                         going to give us a shot at the state
4186,4186,                         championship.  I lay there in my
4187,4187,                         hammock and every time I hear the
4188,4188,"                         sound of breaking glass, I know we're"
4189,4189,                         one step closer to winning it all.
4190,4190,                                     JACKSON
4191,4191,"                         Don't that get kind of expensive,"
4192,4192,                         Cap'n?
4193,4193,                                     MILLER
4194,4194,                         It's worth it.
4195,4195,                                     JACKSON
4196,4196,"                         To each, his own."
4197,4197,               They're all silent for a moment.  Then Miller turns to Ryan.
4198,4198,                                     MILLER
4199,4199,"                         How about you, James?"
4200,4200,               Ryan sighs.
4201,4201,                                     RYAN
4202,4202,"                         I'm home, playing basketball with my"
4203,4203,"                         brothers, it's evenin' time, we're"
4204,4204,                         trying' to get in a few more points
4205,4205,                         before it's too dark to see the ball.
4206,4206,                         That's where I am.
4207,4207,               They all nod.  Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes
4208,4208,               it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on.  They all
4209,4209,               eat in silence.
4210,4210,               
4211,4211, OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN
4212,4212,               First light.  Lovely.  Dew shimmers.  A ground fog drifts.
4213,4213,               A SOUND.  Louder.  And louder.  A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES
4214,4214,               toward the village.

4224,4224,                                     MILLER
4225,4225,                         Here they come.
4226,4226,                                     REIBEN
4227,4227,                         FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
4228,4228,                                     MILLER
4229,4229,                         FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
4230,4230,               THE GERMANS KEEP COMING
4231,4231,               Lots of them.  Moving from cover to cover.  FIRING.
4232,4232,                                     MILLER
4233,4233,                         Manning the forward machine gun.
4234,4234,                         Way out front.  Sees that he's going
4235,4235,                         to be cut off.  He grabs the hot
4236,4236,                         gun.  The barrel burns into his flesh.
4237,4237,                         He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK
4238,4238,                         toward the bridge.
4239,4239,               HE DIVES over the sandbags.  barely makes it.  TRAILED BY

4242,4242,                         Take positions near the bridge.
4243,4243,                         Moving in.  FIRING.  Overwhelming.
4244,4244,                         They're everywhere.
4245,4245,                                     THREE GERMANS
4246,4246,                         Break through the perimeter.
4247,4247,               RYAN SHOOTS one.  GRAPPLES with the other two.
4248,4248,                                     REIBEN
4249,4249,                         Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one

4252,4252,               REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE

4257,4257,                         FIRES again.  More Germans drop.
4258,4258,                                     THE GERMANS
4259,4259,                         Take positions in the building near
4260,4260,                         the bridge.
4261,4261,               They start working their way to the tops of the nearby

4270,4270,                         Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He
4271,4271,                         grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS
4272,4272,                         toward Reiben and Ryan.
4273,4273,               SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM

4275,4275,               BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there.
4276,4276,                                     UPHAM
4277,4277,                         TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart.
4278,4278,                         Stumbles the final few steps to the
4279,4279,                         machine gun nest.  Falls on the
4280,4280,"                         sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the"
4281,4281,                         ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD.
4282,4282,               RYAN STUNNED.
4283,4283,               For just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN
4284,4284,               FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the
4285,4285,               one almost out.
4286,4286,                                     REIBEN

4289,4289,               THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK
4290,4290,                                     MILLER
4291,4291,                         Knows what that means.  He hears the
4292,4292,                         RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
4293,4293,                                     MILLER

4297,4297,                         ammo and race back to the rear nest.
4298,4298,               Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST
4299,4299,               TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two
4300,4300,               German infantry platoons.

4323,4323,                         attention back to the eighty-eight.
4324,4324,                         Frantically turning the aiming cranks.
4325,4325,                         Lowering the barrel to point blank.
4326,4326,               TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT.
4327,4327,               Which can fire first.
4328,4328,                                     MILLER AND RYAN

4365,4365,                         bridge.  Lands on the embankment
4366,4366,                         below.
