25,25,"tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from"
26,26,"famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking"

29,29,"scrubber, fast asleep and snoring."

53,53,"Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge"

60,60,Do you see it? I don't see it... there!
61,61,"Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship"
62,62,"appears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the"
63,63,"bottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standing"
64,64,just as it landed 84 years ago.
65,65,THE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow
66,66,"railing, intact except for an overgrowth of \""rusticles\"" draping it like"

84,84,"sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912,"
85,85,after her long fall from the world above.
86,86,Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches
87,87,the sonar.

89,89,"You are so full of shit, boss."
90,90,"7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while"
91,91,"Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive"
92,92,"anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps"
93,93,gleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous
94,94,wreck.

96,96,Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles
97,97,"down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a"

100,100,"8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's"

103,103,Right. Let's go to work.
104,104,"Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick"

108,108,                               BODINE (V.O.)
109,109,Walkin' the dog.
110,110,"SNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind"
111,111,it like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insect
112,112,eyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful
113,113,First Class Grand Staircase.
114,114,"Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First"
115,115,Class Reception Room.
116,116,"SNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of"
117,117,the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move
118,118,"through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and"
119,119,descending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at
120,120,"times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines"
121,121,of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again.
122,122,"MONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence:"
123,123,"10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a"
124,124,wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights.
125,125,"11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as"
126,126,Snoop moves around it.
127,127,"12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then"
128,128,"some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top \""granny shoe\"". Then"
129,129,something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the
130,130,porcelain head of a doll.
131,131,Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a
132,132,"door still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wall"
133,133,sconce... hint at the grandeur of the past.
134,134,"13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, the"
135,135,"sitting room of a \""promenade suite\"", one of the most luxurious staterooms"
136,136,on Titanic.

142,142,I'm tryin' boss.
143,143,Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly
144,144,preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the
145,145,remains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the
146,146,"once elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe,"
147,147,scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud
148,148,of rust and keeps on going.
149,149,                                  BODINE

156,156,SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving

160,160,"Easy, Lewis. Take it slow."
161,161,"Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it"
162,162,with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is
163,163,a dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under
164,164,the door...

184,184,his moment of glory.
185,185,Everyone crowds around the safe. In the background Mir Two is being lowered
186,186,into its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm. Mir One is already
187,187,recovered with Lewis Bodine following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to the
188,188,safe like a kid on Christman morning.

202,202,"time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to"
203,203,come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If what
204,204,we think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be.
205,205,Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The door
206,206,"is pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering into"
207,207,the safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all.

243,243,"with a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool of"
244,244,light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lower
245,245,right corner is the date: April 14 1912. And the initials JD.
246,246,The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with one
247,247,large stone hanging in the center.
248,248,Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is a

1110,1110,"appointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she"
1111,1111,is...
1112,1112,                           (he slaps the table)
1113,1113,...willed into solid reality.
1114,1114,                                   MOLLY
1115,1115,"Why're ships always bein' called \""she\""? Is it because men think half the"
1116,1116,women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage?
1117,1117,                             (they all laugh)
1118,1118,Just another example of the men settin' the rules their way.
1119,1119,The waiter arrives to take orders. Rose lights a cigarette.
1120,1120,                                   RUTH
1121,1121,"You know I don't like that, Rose."
1122,1122,                                    CAL
1123,1123,She knows.
1124,1124,Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out.
1125,1125,                                    CAL
1126,1126,                              (to the waiter)
1127,1127,"We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce."
1128,1128,"                  (to Rose, after the waiter moves away)"
1129,1129,"You like lamb, don't you sweetpea?"
1130,1130,"Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth."
1131,1131,                                   MOLLY
1132,1132,"So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?"
1133,1133,                            (turning to Ismay)
1134,1134,"Hey, who came up with the name Titanic? You, Bruce?"
1135,1135,                                   ISMAY
1136,1136,"Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability,"
1137,1137,luxury... and safety--
1138,1138,                                   ROSE
1139,1139,Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size
1140,1140,"might be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay."
1141,1141,"Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter."
1142,1142,                                   RUTH
1143,1143,"My God, Rose, what's gotten into--"
1144,1144,                                   ROSE
1145,1145,Excuse me.
1146,1146,She stalks away.
1147,1147,                                   RUTH
1148,1148,                                (mortified)
1149,1149,I do apologize.
1150,1150,                                   MOLLY
1151,1151,"She's a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle her?"
1152,1152,                                    CAL
1153,1153,                      (tense but feigning unconcern)
1154,1154,"Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on."
1155,1155,                                                                   
1156,1156,60
1157,1157, POOP DECK / AFTER DECKS - DAY
1158,1158,Jack sits on a bench in the sun. Titanic's wake spreads out behind him to
1159,1159,"the horizon. He has his knees pulled up, supporting a leather bound"
1160,1160,"sketching pad, his only valuable possession. With conte crayon he draws"
1161,1161,"rapidly, using sure strokes. An emigrant from Manchester named CARTMELL has"
1162,1162,his 3 year old daughter CORA standing on the lower rung of the rail. She is
1163,1163,"leaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, watching the seagulls."
1164,1164,"THE SKETCH captures them perfectly, with a great sense of the humanity of"
1165,1165,the moment. Jack is good. Really good. Fabrizio looks over Jack's shoulder.
1166,1166,He nods appreciatively.
1167,1167,"TOMMY RYAN, a scowling young Irish emigrant, watches as a crewmember comes"
1168,1168,"by, walking three small dogs around the deck. One of them, a BLACK FRENCH"
1169,1169,"BULLDOG, is among the ugliest creatures on the planet."
1170,1170,                                   TOMMY
1171,1171,That's typical. First class dogs come down here to take a shit.
1172,1172,Jack looks up from his sketch.
1173,1173,                                   JACK
1174,1174,That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things.
1175,1175,                                   TOMMY
1176,1176,Like we could forget.
1177,1177,Jack glances across the well deck. At the aft railing of B deck promenade
1178,1178,"stands ROSE, in a long yellow dress and white gloves."
1179,1179,"CLOSE ON JACK, unable to take his eyes off of her. They are across from"
1180,1180,"each other, about 60 feet apart, with the well deck like a valley between"
1181,1181,"them. She on her promontory, he on his much lower one. She stares down at"
1182,1182,the water.
1183,1183,He watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off. She looks at the
1184,1184,"frilly absurd thing, then tosses it over the rail. It sails far down to the"
1185,1185,"water and is carried away, astern. A spot of yellow in the vast ocean. He"
1186,1186,"is riveted by her. She looks like a figure in a romantic novel, sad and"
1187,1187,isolated.
1188,1188,Fabrizio taps Tommy and they both look at Jack gazin at Rose. Fabrizio and
1189,1189,Tommy grin at each other.
1190,1190,"Rose turns suddenly and looks right at Jack. He is caught staring, but he"
1191,1191,"doesn't look away. She does, but then looks back. Their eyes meet across"
1192,1192,"the space of the well deck, across the gulf between worlds."
1193,1193,Jack sees a man (Cal) come up behind her and take her arm. She jerks her
1194,1194,"arm away. They argue in pantomime. She storms away, and he goes after her,"
1195,1195,disappearing along the A-deck promenade. Jack stares after her.
1196,1196,                                   TOMMY
1197,1197,"Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out o' yer arse as get next"
1198,1198,to the likes o' her.
1199,1199,                                                                   
1200,1200,61
1201,1201, FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON - NIGHT
1202,1202,"SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON ROSE as she sits, flanked by people in heated"
1203,1203,"conversation. Cal and Ruth are laughing together, while on the other side"
1204,1204,LADY DUFF-GORDON is holding forth animatedly. We don't hear what they are
1205,1205,"saying. Rose is staring at her plate, barely listening to the"
1206,1206,inconsequential babble around her.
1207,1207,                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)
1208,1208,I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of
1209,1209,"parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow"
1210,1210,"people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great"
1211,1211,"precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even"
1212,1212,noticed.
1213,1213,"ANGLE BENEATH TABLE showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab"
1214,1214,"salad. She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and harder"
1215,1215,until it draws blood.
1216,1216,                                                                   
1217,1217,62
1218,1218, CORRIDOR / B DECK - NIGHT
1219,1219,"Rose walks along the corridor. A steward coming the other way greets her,"
1220,1220,and she nods with a slight smile. She is perfectly composed.
1221,1221,                                                                   
1222,1222,63
1223,1223, ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
1224,1224,"She enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the"
1225,1225,"large vanity mirror. Just stands there, then--"
1226,1226,"With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearl"
1227,1227,"necklace, which explodes across the room. In a frenzy she tears at herself,"
1228,1228,"her clothes, her hair... then attacks the room. She flings everything off"
1229,1229,the dresser and it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls a
1230,1230,"handmirror against the vanity, cracking it."
1231,1231,                                                                   
1232,1232,64
1233,1233," A DECK PROMENADE, AFT - NIGHT"
1234,1234,"Rose runs along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, her hair flying."
1235,1235,"She is crying, her cheeks streaked with tears. But also angry, furious!"
1236,1236,"Shaking with emotions she doesn't understand... hatred, self-hatred,"
1237,1237,desperation. A strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotional
1238,1238,display in public.
1239,1239,                                                                   
1240,1240,65
1241,1241, POOP DECK - NIGHT
1242,1242,Jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing
1243,1243,gloriously overhead. Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette.
1244,1244,"Hearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from the well deck."
1245,1245,"They are the only two on the stern deck, except for QUARTERMASTER ROWE,"
1246,1246,twenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk. She doesn't see Jack
1247,1247,"in the shadows, and runs right past him."
1248,1248,TRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. Her breath
1249,1249,"hitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. Rose slams against the"
1250,1250,"base of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting. She stares out at the"
1251,1251,black water.
1252,1252,Then starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her long dress way
1253,1253,"up, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically she turns her body and gets"
1254,1254,"her heels on the white-painted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing out"
1255,1255,"toward blackness. 60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churning"
1256,1256,"the atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward the"
1257,1257,horizon.
1258,1258,"IN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse. Below"
1259,1259,"her are the huge letters of the name \""TITANIC\""."
1260,1260,"She leans out, her arms straightening... looking down hypnotized, into the"
1261,1261,vortex below her. Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship's
1262,1262,"movement. The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter and"
1263,1263,snap of the big Union Jack right above her.
1264,1264,                                   JACK
1265,1265,Don't do it.
1266,1266,She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for
1267,1267,her eyes to focus.
1268,1268,                                   ROSE
1269,1269,Stay back! Don't come any closer!
1270,1270,Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern
1271,1271,running lights.
1272,1272,                                   JACK
1273,1273,Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
1274,1274,                                   ROSE
1275,1275,No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
1276,1276,                                   JACK
1277,1277,No you won't.
1278,1278,                                   ROSE
1279,1279,What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will
1280,1280,not do. You don't know me.
1281,1281,                                   JACK
1282,1282,"You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand."
1283,1283,"Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she"
1284,1284,"wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance."
1285,1285,                                   ROSE
1286,1286,You're distracting me. Go away.
1287,1287,                                   JACK
1288,1288,I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
1289,1289,                                   ROSE
1290,1290,Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
1291,1291,He takes off his jacket.
1292,1292,                                   JACK
1293,1293,I'm a good swimmer.
1294,1294,He starts unlacing his left shoe.
1295,1295,                                   ROSE
1296,1296,The fall alone would kill you.
1297,1297,                                   JACK
1298,1298,It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more
1299,1299,concerned about the water being so cold.
1300,1300,She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in.
1301,1301,                                   ROSE
1302,1302,How cold?
1303,1303,                                   JACK
1304,1304,                        (taking off his left shoe)
1305,1305,Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
1306,1306,He starts unlacing his right shoe.
1307,1307,                                   JACK
1308,1308,Ever been to Wisconsin?
1309,1309,                                   ROSE
1310,1310,                                (perplexed)
1311,1311,No.
1312,1312,                                   JACK
1313,1313,"Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there,"
1314,1314,near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were
1315,1315,ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in
1316,1316,the--
1317,1317,                                   ROSE
1318,1318,I know what ice fishing is!
1319,1319,                                   JACK
1320,1320,"Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through"
1321,1321,"some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down"
1322,1322,there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't
1323,1323,"breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain."
1324,1324,                        (takes off his other shoe)
1325,1325,Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I
1326,1326,"said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over"
1327,1327,the rail and get me off the hook here.
1328,1328,                                   ROSE
1329,1329,You're crazy.
1330,1330,                                   JACK
1331,1331,"That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one"
1332,1332,hanging off the back of a ship.
1333,1333,"He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse."
1334,1334,                                   JACK
1335,1335,Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.
1336,1336,Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they
1337,1337,somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.
1338,1338,                                   ROSE
1339,1339,Alright.
1340,1340,She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He
1341,1341,"reaches out to take it, firmly."
1342,1342,                                   JACK
1343,1343,I'm Jack Dawson.
1344,1344,                                   ROSE
1345,1345,                             (voice quavering)
1346,1346,"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson."
1347,1347,"Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is"
1348,1348,"terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning"
1349,1349,"to face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and"
1350,1350,one foot slips off the edge of the deck.
1351,1351,"She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is"
1352,1352,jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.
1353,1353,"QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for"
1354,1354,the ladder.
1355,1355,                                   ROSE
1356,1356,HELP! HELP!!
1357,1357,                                   JACK
1358,1358,I've got you. I won't let go.
1359,1359,"Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing"
1360,1360,with his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth
1361,1361,hull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any
1362,1362,"footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS"

1606,1606,                            (looks at him hard)
1607,1607,You think she was really there?
1608,1608,                                  LOVETT
1609,1609,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there."
1610,1610,                                                                   
1611,1611,70
1612,1612, IMAGING SHACK
1613,1613,Bodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THE
1614,1614,LIVE FEED FROM THE WRECK--SNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side of
1615,1615,"the hull, heading aft. The rectangular windows of A deck (forward) march"
1616,1616,past on the right.
1617,1617,                                   ROSE
1618,1618,"The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt."
1619,1619,                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
1620,1620,71
1621,1621, B DECK TITANIC - DAY
1622,1622,"MATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912,"
1623,1623,passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the
1624,1624,sunlight right in front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking with
1625,1625,purpose.
1626,1626,                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)
1627,1627,As if I hadn't felt the sun in years.
1628,1628,"IT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down into"
1629,1629,third class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare
1630,1630,at her.
1631,1631,                                                                   
1632,1632,72
1633,1633, THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM
1634,1634,The social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to the
1635,1635,"opulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are mothers"
1636,1636,"with babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languages"
1637,1637,"and being scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing"
1638,1638,"chess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even an"
1639,1639,upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it.
1640,1640,"Three boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a rat"
1641,1641,"under the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general"
1642,1642,"havoc. Jack is playing with 5 year old CORA CARTMeLL, drawing funny faces"
1643,1643,together in his sketchbook.
1644,1644,Fabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive
1645,1645,"Norwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family at a table across the"
1646,1646,room.
1647,1647,                                 FABRIZIO
1648,1648,No Italian? Some little English?
1649,1649,                                   HELGA
1650,1650,"No, no. Norwegian. Only."
1651,1651,"Helga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a take... and"
1652,1652,"Jack, curious, follows their gaze to see..."
1653,1653,"Rose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... a hush falls."
1654,1654,Rose feels suddenly self-conscious as the steerage passengers stare openly
1655,1655,"at this princess, some with resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack and"
1656,1656,"gives a little smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her,"
1657,1657,smiling.
1658,1658,                                   ROSE
1659,1659,Hello Jack.
1660,1660,Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella.
1661,1661,                                   JACK
1662,1662,Hello again.
1663,1663,                                   ROSE
1664,1664,Could I speak to you in private?
1665,1665,                                   JACK
1666,1666,"Uh, yes. Of course. After you."
1667,1667,"He motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, one"
1668,1668,"eyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence."
1669,1669,                                                                   
1670,1670,73
1671,1671, BOAT DECK - DAY
1672,1672,Jack and Rose walk side by side. They pass people reading and talking in
1673,1673,"steamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple. He"
1674,1674,"feels out of place in his rough clothes. They are both awkward, for"
1675,1675,different reasons.
1676,1676,                                   JACK
1677,1677,"So, you got a name by the way?"
1678,1678,                                   ROSE
1679,1679,Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
1680,1680,                                   JACK
1681,1681,That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
1682,1682,There is an awkward pause.
1683,1683,                                   ROSE
1684,1684,"Mr. Dawson, I--"
1685,1685,                                   JACK
1686,1686,Jack.
1687,1687,                                   ROSE
1688,1688,Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the
1689,1689,nerve to face you.
1690,1690,                                   JACK
1691,1691,"Well, here you are."
1692,1692,                                   ROSE
1693,1693,Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for
1694,1694,pulling me back. But for your discretion.
1695,1695,                                   JACK
1696,1696,You're welcome. Rose.
1697,1697,                                   ROSE
1698,1698,"Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does"
1699,1699,she know about misery?
1700,1700,                                   JACK
1701,1701,That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have
1702,1702,happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
1703,1703,                                   ROSE
1704,1704,"I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was"
1705,1705,"their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber."
1706,1706,                                (in a rush)
1707,1707,I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the
1708,1708,back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough.
1709,1709,"Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I"
1710,1710,was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
1711,1711,                                   JACK
1712,1712,Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
1713,1713,                                   ROSE
1714,1714,                           (she lowers her head)
1715,1715,"Oh God, I am such an utter fool."
1716,1716,                                   JACK
1717,1717,"That penguin last night, is he one of them?"
1718,1718,                                   ROSE
1719,1719,"Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them."
1720,1720,                                   JACK
1721,1721,Is he your boyfriend?
1722,1722,                                   ROSE
1723,1723,Worse I'm afraid.
1724,1724,She shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond.
1725,1725,                                   JACK
1726,1726,Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom.
1727,1727,"They laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not a"
1728,1728,"first class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away."
1729,1729,                                   JACK
1730,1730,So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're
1731,1731,marryin' this fella.
1732,1732,                                   ROSE
1733,1733,"Yes, exactly!"
1734,1734,                                   JACK
1735,1735,So don't marry him.
1736,1736,                                   ROSE
1737,1737,If only it were that simple.
1738,1738,                                   JACK
1739,1739,It is that simple.
1740,1740,                                   ROSE
1741,1741,"Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world."
1742,1742,                                   JACK
1743,1743,"Well, I guess I will tonight."
1744,1744,"Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook."
1745,1745,                                   ROSE
1746,1746,What's this?
1747,1747,                                   JACK
1748,1748,Just some sketches.
1749,1749,                                   ROSE
1750,1750,May I?
1751,1751,The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. She
1752,1752,sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... each
1753,1753,"one an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping"
1754,1754,"man, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive."
1755,1755,His book is a celebration of the human condition.
1756,1756,                                   ROSE
1757,1757,"Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are."
1758,1758,                                   JACK
1759,1759,"Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree."
1760,1760,Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scrambles
1761,1761,"after them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail."
1762,1762,                                   ROSE
1763,1763,"Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!"
1764,1764,                                   JACK
1765,1765,"Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree."
1766,1766,"He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish."
1767,1767,                                   JACK
1768,1768,"I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway."
1769,1769,For emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail off.
1770,1770,                                   ROSE
1771,1771,                                (laughing)
1772,1772,You're deranged!
1773,1773,"She goes back to the book, turning a page."
1774,1774,                                   ROSE
1775,1775,"Well, well..."
1776,1776,She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languid
1777,1777,"beauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands"
1778,1778,and eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form...
1779,1779,"almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as some"
1780,1780,strollers go by.
1781,1781,                                   ROSE
1782,1782,                         (trying to be very adult)
1783,1783,And these were drawn from life?
1784,1784,                                   JACK
1785,1785,Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take
1786,1786,their clothes off.
1787,1787,"She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight,"
1788,1788,"half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a"
1789,1789,"flower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print"
1790,1790,of Georgia O'Keefe.
1791,1791,                                   ROSE
1792,1792,You liked this woman. You used her several times.
1793,1793,                                   JACK
1794,1794,She had beautiful hands.
1795,1795,                                   ROSE
1796,1796,                                 (smiling)
1797,1797,I think you must have had a love affair with her...
1798,1798,                                   JACK
1799,1799,                                (laughing)
1800,1800,"No, no! Just with her hands."
1801,1801,                                   ROSE
1802,1802,                      (looking up from the drawings)
1803,1803,"You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people."
1804,1804,                                   JACK
1805,1805,I see you.
1806,1806,There it is. That piercing gaze again.
1807,1807,                                   ROSE
1808,1808,And...?
1809,1809,                                   JACK
1810,1810,You wouldn'ta jumped.
1811,1811,

1814,1814,"Ruth is having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYER-EDWARDES, the COUNTESS OF"
1815,1815,"ROTHES, a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician features. Ruth sees"
1816,1816,someone coming across the room and lowers her voice.
1817,1817,                                   RUTH
1818,1818,"Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way. Get up, quickly before"
1819,1819,she sits with us.
1820,1820,"Molly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising."
1821,1821,                                   MOLLY
1822,1822,"Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea."
1823,1823,                                   RUTH
1824,1824,We're awfully sorry you missed it. The Countess and I are just off to take
1825,1825,the air on the boat deck.
1826,1826,                                   MOLLY
1827,1827,That sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip.
1828,1828,Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to
1829,1829,"go up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to"
1830,1830,Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table.
1831,1831,                                   ISMAY
1832,1832,So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
1833,1833,                                   SMITH
1834,1834,"No, but we're making excellent time."
1835,1835,                                   ISMAY
1836,1836,                               (impatiently)
1837,1837,"Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed"
1838,1838,too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of
1839,1839,Titnaic must make headlines!
1840,1840,                                   SMITH
1841,1841,I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
1842,1842,                                   ISMAY
1843,1843,"Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a"
1844,1844,glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night
1845,1845,and surprise them all.
1846,1846,                    (Ismay slaps his hand on the table)
1847,1847,"Retire with a bang, eh, E.J?"
1848,1848,"A beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy."
1849,1849,

1851,1851, A DECK PROMENADE - DAY
1852,1852,"Rose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the"
1853,1853,slanting late-afternoon light. Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa.
1854,1854,                                   ROSE
1855,1855,                           (girlish and excited)
1856,1856,"You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an"
1857,1857,"artist... living in a garret, poor but free!"
1858,1858,                                   JACK
1859,1859,                                (laughing)
1860,1860,"You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any"
1861,1861,caviar.
1862,1862,                                   ROSE
1863,1863,                            (angry in a flash)
1864,1864,"Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my"
1865,1865,dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
1866,1866,                                   JACK
1867,1867,I'm sorry. Really... I am.
1868,1868,                                   ROSE
1869,1869,"Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what"
1870,1870,"it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like"
1871,1871,Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
1872,1872,"She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees"
1873,1873,something ahead and her face lights up.
1874,1874,                                   ROSE
1875,1875,...or a moving picture actress!
1876,1876,"She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward--"
1877,1877,DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as
1878,1878,she poses stiffly at the rail.
1879,1879,                                  MARVIN
1880,1880,"You're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've left your lover on the shore. You may"
1881,1881,"never see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling."
1882,1882,SUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the
1883,1883,rail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. Rose pulls Jack into the
1884,1884,picture and makes him pose.
1885,1885,"Marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this in CUTS, with"
1886,1886,music and no dialogue.
1887,1887,SERIES OF CUTS:
1888,1888,"Rose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead."
1889,1889,"Jack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomiming"
1890,1890,fanning him like slave girls.
1891,1891,"Jack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing,"
1892,1892,turns her head in bored disdain.
1893,1893,"Rose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shoot-out."
1894,1894,"Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like Snidely"
1895,1895,Whiplash.
1896,1896,

1898,1898, A DECK PROMENADE / AFT - SUNSET
1899,1899,"Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck rail aft,"
1900,1900,shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on.
1901,1901,It is a magical moment... perfect.
1902,1902,                                   ROSE
1903,1903,"So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?"
1904,1904,                                   JACK
1905,1905,"Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los"
1906,1906,"Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a"
1907,1907,rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
1908,1908,                                   ROSE
1909,1909,A whole ten cents?!
1910,1910,                                   JACK
1911,1911,                             (not getting it)
1912,1912,"Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But"
1913,1913,"only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the"
1914,1914,real artists were doing.
1915,1915,                                   ROSE
1916,1916,                          (looks at the dusk sky)
1917,1917,Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel
1918,1918,like it.
1919,1919,                             (turning to him)
1920,1920,"Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just"
1921,1921,talk about it.
1922,1922,                                   JACK
1923,1923,"Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster"
1924,1924,until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the
1925,1925,"surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff."
1926,1926,                                   ROSE
1927,1927,You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
1928,1928,                                   JACK
1929,1929,Sure. If you like.
1930,1930,                                   ROSE
1931,1931,                             (smiling at him)
1932,1932,I think I would.
1933,1933,                        (she looks at the horizon)
1934,1934,And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit.
1935,1935,It's unfair.
1936,1936,                                   JACK
1937,1937,"They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch"
1938,1938,closely.
1939,1939,He spits. It arcs out over the water.
1940,1940,                                   JACK
1941,1941,Your turn.
1942,1942,Rose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of foamy spittle
1943,1943,which mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water.
1944,1944,                                   JACK
1945,1945,"Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!..."
1946,1946,"then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath"
1947,1947,and PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing?
1948,1948,"She goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches her through it"
1949,1949,(ad lib) while doing the steps himself. She lets fly. So does he. Two
1950,1950,comets of gob fly out over the water.
1951,1951,                                   JACK
1952,1952,That was great!
1953,1953,"Rose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. He sees her"
1954,1954,expression and turns.
1955,1955,"RUTH, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching them"
1956,1956,hawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed.
1957,1957,                                   ROSE
1958,1958,"Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson."
1959,1959,                                   RUTH
1960,1960,"Charmed, I'm sure."
1961,1961,Jack has a little spit running down his chin. He doesn't know it. Molly
1962,1962,"Brown is grinning. As Rose proceeds with the introductions, we hear..."
1963,1963,                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)
1964,1964,The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But
1965,1965,my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be
1966,1966,squashed quickly.
1967,1967,                                   MOLLY
1968,1968,"Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky"
1969,1969,spot--
1970,1970,They all jump as a BUGLER sounds the meal call right behind them.
1971,1971,                                   MOLLY
1972,1972,Why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge?
1973,1973,                                   ROSE
1974,1974,"Shall we go dress, mother?"
1975,1975,                            (over her shoulder)
1976,1976,"See you at dinner, Jack."
1977,1977,                                   RUTH
1978,1978,                            (as they walk away)
1979,1979,"Rose, look at you... out in the sun with no hat. Honestly!"
1980,1980,"The Countess exits with Ruth and Rose, leaving Jack and Molly alone on"
1981,1981,deck.
1982,1982,                                   MOLLY
1983,1983,"Son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing?"
1984,1984,                                   JACK
1985,1985,Not really.
1986,1986,                                   MOLLY
1987,1987,"Well, you're about to go into the snakepit. I hope you're ready. What are"
1988,1988,you planning to wear?
1989,1989,Jack looks down at his clothes. Back up at her. He hadn't thought about
1990,1990,that.
1991,1991,                                   MOLLY
1992,1992,I figured.
1993,1993,                                                                   
1994,1994,77
1995,1995, MOLLY BROWN'S STATEROOM
1996,1996,Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place.
1997,1997,"Molly is having a fine time. Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and"
1998,1998,Molly is tying his bow tie.
1999,1999,                                   MOLLY
2000,2000,Don't feel bad about it. My husband still can't tie one of these damn
2001,2001,things after 20 years. There you go.
2002,2002,She picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. Jack goes into the
2003,2003,bathroom to put it on. Molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed.
2004,2004,                                   MOLLY
2005,2005,I gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause I never know how much he's
2006,2006,been eating while I'm away.
2007,2007,"She turns and sees him, though we don't."
2008,2008,                                   MOLLY
2009,2009,"My, my, my... you shine up like a new penny."
2010,2010,

2012,2012, BOAT DECK / FIRST CLAsS ENTRANCE - DUSK
2013,2013,"A purple sky, shot with orange, in the west. Drifting strains of classic"
2014,2014,music. We TRACK WITH JACK along the deck. By Edwardian standards he looks
2015,2015,"badass. Dashing in his borrowed white-tie outfit, right down to his pearl"
2016,2016,studs.
2017,2017,A steward bows and smartly opens the door to the First Class Entrance.
2018,2018,                                  STEWARD
2019,2019,"Good evening, sir."
2020,2020,Jack plays the role smoothly. Nods with just the right degree of disdain.
2021,2021,                                                                   
2022,2022,79
2023,2023, UPPER LANDING / GRAND STAIRCASE AND A-DECK
2024,2024,Jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out
2025,2025,"before him. Overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal chandelier"
2026,2026,at its center. Sweeping down six stories is the First Class Grand
2027,2027,"Staircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time."
2028,2028,"And the people: the women in their floor length dresses, elaborate"
2029,2029,"hairstyles and abundant jewelry... the gentlemen in evening dress, standing"
2030,2030,"with one hand at the small of the back, talking quietly."
2031,2031,Jack descends to A deck. Several men nod a perfunctory greeting. He nods
2032,2032,"back, keeping it simple. He feels like a spy."
2033,2033,"Cal comes down the stairs, with Ruth on his arm, covered in jewelry. They"
2034,2034,"both walk right past Jack, neither one gecognizeing him. Cal nods at him,"
2035,2035,one gent to another. But Jack barely has time to be amused. Because just
2036,2036,"behind Cal and Ruth on the stairs is Rose, a vision in red and black, her"
2037,2037,"low-cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her arms seathed in white"
2038,2038,gloves that come well above above the elbow. Jack is hypnotized by her
2039,2039,beauty.
2040,2040,"CLOSE ON ROSE as she approaches Jack. He imitates the gentlemen's stance,"
2041,2041,"hand behind his back. She extends her gloved hand and he takes it, kissing"
2042,2042,"the back of her fingers. Rose flushes, beaming noticeably. She can't take"
2043,2043,her eyes off him.
2044,2044,                                   JACK
2045,2045,"I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it."
2046,2046,                                   ROSE
2047,2047,"Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson."
2048,2048,                                    CAL
2049,2049,                            (caught off guard)
2050,2050,Dawson! I didn't recognize you.
2051,2051,                               (studies him)
2052,2052,Amazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen.
2053,2053,

2056,2056,"CUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. They"
2057,2057,"encounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty"
2058,2058,broad-shouldered way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are going
2059,2059,"into the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low:"
2060,2060,                                   MOLLY
2061,2061,"Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?"
2062,2062,                                   JACK
2063,2063,"Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up."
2064,2064,                                   MOLLY
2065,2065,"Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got"
2066,2066,a lot of it and you're in the club.
2067,2067,"As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out"
2068,2068,several notables.
2069,2069,                                   ROSE
2070,2070,There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man
2071,2071,"on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate"
2072,2072,condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal.
2073,2073,                         (nodding toward a couple)
2074,2074,"And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs"
2075,2075,"naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals."
2076,2076,Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and Colonel
2077,2077,"Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots"
2078,2078,"Jack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably."
2079,2079,                                   ROSE
2080,2080,"And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs."
2081,2081,"Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course."
2082,2082,"Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are"
2083,2083,looking at Rose like a prize show horse.
2084,2084,                                 SIR COSMO
2085,2085,"Hockley, she is splendid."
2086,2086,                                    CAL
2087,2087,Thank you.

2089,2089,"Cal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck."
2090,2090,"Ruth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, somewhat"
2091,2091,coquettishly.
2092,2092,                                   RUTH
2093,2093,How can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch.
2094,2094,"The entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into the"
2095,2095,Astor's going through the ornate double doors.

2099,2099,                            (shaking his hand)
2100,2100,Good to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston Dawsons?
2101,2101,                                   JACK
2102,2102,"No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually."
2103,2103,"J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astor"
2104,2104,appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose:
2105,2105,                                 MADELEINE
2106,2106,"It's a pity we're both spoken for, isn't it?"
2107,2107,

2109,2109, DINING SALOON
2110,2110,"Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation of"
2111,2111,"chandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from"
2112,2112,BANDLEADER WALLACE HARTLEY'S small orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter and
2113,2113,"move across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear..."
2114,2114,                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)
2115,2115,He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of
2116,2116,"them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but"
2117,2117,"still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted"
2118,2118,upon...
2119,2119,

2124,2124,"Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite"
2125,2125,good on this ship.
2126,2126,"WIDER: THE TABLE. Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal and"
2127,2127,"Thomas Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel Gracie,"
2128,2128,"the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the Astors."
2129,2129,                                   JACK
2130,2130,"The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats."
2131,2131,Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate.
2132,2132,                                    CAL
2133,2133,Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my
2134,2134,fiancee last night.
2135,2135,"                        (to Jack, as if to a child)"
2136,2136,This is foie gras. It's goose liver.
2137,2137,We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Now
2138,2138,they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous.

2143,2143,                                 (to Jack)

2146,2146,                            (answering for him)
2147,2147,Just a soupcon of lemon...
2148,2148,"                            (to Jack, smiling)"
2149,2149,...it improves the flavor with champagne.

2152,2152,"No caviar for me, thanks."
2153,2153,                                 (to Cal)
2154,2154,Never did like it much.
2155,2155,"He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles."
2156,2156,                                   RUTH
2157,2157,"And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?"
2158,2158,                                   JACK
2159,2159,"Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's"
2160,2160,good humor.
2161,2161,Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look and
2162,2162,"picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks."
2163,2163,                                   RUTH
2164,2164,"You find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you?"
2165,2165,                                   JACK
2166,2166,"Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father"
2167,2167,was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was
2168,2168,"born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never"
2169,2169,"know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire"
2170,2170,"when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that"
2171,2171,teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.
2172,2172,Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute.
2173,2173,                                   MOLLY
2174,2174,"Well said, Jack."

2179,2179,                                   ROSE
2180,2180,To making it count.
2181,2181,"Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further."
2182,2182,                                   RUTH
2183,2183,"How is it you have the means to travel, Mr. Dawson?"
2184,2184,                                   JACK
2185,2185,I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket
2186,2186,on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.
2187,2187,                           (he glances at Rose)
2188,2188,A very lucky hand.
2189,2189,                                  GRACIE
2190,2190,All life is a game of luck.

2195,2195,                                   ROSE
2196,2196,"Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this"
2197,2197,little book.
2198,2198,                           (grabs it and reads)
2199,2199,Increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3. You build the biggest
2200,2200,ship in the world and this preoccupies you?!
2201,2201,Andrews smiles sheepishly.
2202,2202,                                   ISMAY
2203,2203,"He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas?"
2204,2204,                                  ANDREWS
2205,2205,All three million of them.
2206,2206,                                   ISMAY
2207,2207,"His blood and soul are in the ship. She may be mine on paper, but in the"
2208,2208,eyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews.
2209,2209,                                   ROSE
2210,2210,"Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly."
2211,2211,                                  ANDREWS
2212,2212,"Thankyou, Rose."
2213,2213,We see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell.
2214,2214,83 TIME TRANSITION: Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with
2215,2215,cigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start clipping ends and

2228,2228,"Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you?"
2229,2229,"Actually he does, but..."
2230,2230,                                   JACK
2231,2231,No thanks. I'm heading back.
2232,2232,                                    CAL
2233,2233,"Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing."
2234,2234,Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
2235,2235,Cal and te other gentlemen exit.

2239,2239,Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
2240,2240,He leans over to take her hand.
2241,2241,
2242,2242, We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm.
2243,2243,"Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room. Rose"
2244,2244,"surreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: \""Make it count."

2250,2250,"is the crystal dome. Jack has his back to her, studying the ornate clock"
2251,2251,with its carved figures of Honor and Glory. It softly strikes the hour.
2252,2252,MOVING WITH ROSE as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him. He
2253,2253,"turns, sees her... smiles."
2254,2254,                                   JACK

2259,2259,"Crow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. An ad hoc"
2260,2260,"band is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music"
2261,2261,"on fiddle, accoridon and tambourine. People of all ages are dancing,"
2262,2262,"drinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling."
2263,2263,Tommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. Jack meanwhile dances
2264,2264,"with 5 year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet."
2265,2265,"As the tune ends, Rose leans down to the little girl."

2269,2269,"You're still my best girl, Cora."
2270,2270,Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as he
2271,2271,takes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of her
2272,2272,back. It is an electrifying moment.
2273,2273,                                   ROSE
2274,2274,I don't know the steps.
2275,2275,                                   JACK
2276,2276,Just move with me. Don't think.
2277,2277,"The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts to"
2278,2278,get into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the
2279,2279,steops.
2280,2280,                                   ROSE
2281,2281,Wait... stop!
2282,2282,"She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them to"
2283,2283,"Tommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancing"
2284,2284,faster as the music speeds up.
2285,2285,

2289,2289,The scene is rowdy and rollicking. A table gets knocked over as a drunk
2290,2290,crashes into it. And in the middle of it... Rose dancing with Jack in her
2291,2291,stocking feet. The steps are fast and she shines with sweat. A space opens
2292,2292,"around them, and people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster and"
2293,2293,faster.
2294,2294,FABRIZIO AND HELGA. Dancing has obviated the need for a common language. He
2295,2295,"whirls her, then she responds by whirling him... Fabrizio's eyes go wide"
2296,2296,when he realizes she's stronger than he is.
2297,2297,"The tune ends in a mad rush. Jack steps away from Rose with a flourish,"
2298,2298,"allowing her to take a bow. Exhilarated and slightly tipsy, she does a"
2299,2299,"graceful ballet ployer, feet turned out perfectly. Everyone laughs and"
2300,2300,"applauds. Rose is a hit with the steerage folks, who've never had a lady"
2301,2301,party with them.
2302,2302,"They move to a table, flushed and sweaty. Rose grabs Fabrizio's cigarette"
2303,2303,"and takes a big drag. She's feeling cocky. Fabrizio is grinning, holding"
2304,2304,hands with Helga.

2313,2313,"Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy,"

2327,2327,"In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up"
2328,2328,"on point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gape"
2329,2329,"at her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screws"
2330,2330,"up in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around."

2332,2332,Oooowww! I haven't done that in years.
2333,2333,"Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up."
2334,2334,THE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through

2346,2346,In the air she goes. Where? There she goes!
2347,2347,They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First
2348,2348,"Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end."

2362,2362,You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.

2377,2377,                                   ROSE
2378,2378,I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
2379,2379,"Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. It"
2380,2380,"would be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems"
2381,2381,to be thinking the same thing.
2382,2382,                                   JACK

2396,2396,"SUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across the"
2397,2397,promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension is
2398,2398,"palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes"
2399,2399,inside.
2400,2400,                                    CAL

2403,2403,I was tired.
2404,2404,                                    CAL
2405,2405,Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
2406,2406,                                   ROSE
2407,2407,                               (stiffening)

2409,2409,                                    CAL
2410,2410,You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?

2412,2412,I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your
2413,2413,fiancee--
2414,2414,"Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. He"
2415,2415,"moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the"
2416,2416,"sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms."
2417,2417,                                    CAL
2418,2418,"Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will"
2419,2419,"honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made"
2420,2420,out a fool! Is this in any way unclear?
2421,2421,"Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the"
2422,2422,door bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens
2423,2423,"up. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom."
2424,2424,                                   ROSE
2425,2425,"We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy."

2432,2432,"You are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it!"
2433,2433,Rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the
2434,2434,corset strings with both hands.
2435,2435,                                   ROSE
2436,2436,"Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed."

2445,2445,Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good
2446,2446,name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
2447,2447,Rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. Ruth sucks in her
2448,2448,waist and Rose pulls.
2449,2449,                                   RUTH
2450,2450,"I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure"

2457,2457,                                   RUTH
2458,2458,Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you
2459,2459,"want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to"
2460,2460,"the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?"
2461,2461,                                   ROSE
2462,2462,It's so unfair.
2463,2463,                                   RUTH
2464,2464,Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
2465,2465,Rose pulls the corset tighter.

2554,2554,from behind one of the huge deck cranes and calmly picks up the coat and

2600,2600,"behind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on the arm and she turns,"
2601,2601,gasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which

2609,2609,                                   ROSE
2610,2610,"Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you."
2611,2611,He takes her by the shoulders.

2619,2619,No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have

2622,2622,alright.
2623,2623,Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... not
2624,2624,like anyone she has ever known.
2625,2625,                                   ROSE

2646,2646,Of course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. And

2649,2649,"REVERSE, ROSE'S POV: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The four"
2650,2650,"year old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. The"
2651,2651,"mother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup. The"
2652,2652,"little girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious. A glimpse"
2653,2653,"of Rose at that age, and we see the relentless conditioning... the pain to"
2654,2654,becoming an Edwardian geisha.
2655,2655,"ON ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling tea"

2664,2664,"is there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. He"
2665,2665,"closes his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head."

2667,2667,                                   ROSE
2668,2668,"Hello, Jack."
2669,2669,He turns and she is standing there.
2670,2670,                                   ROSE
2671,2671,I changed my mind.

2675,2675,Fabrizio said you might be up--

2677,2677,Sssshh. Come here.
2678,2678,He puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her.
2679,2679,                                   JACK
2680,2680,Close your eyes.
2681,2681,"She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. He"
2682,2682,"presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takes"
2683,2683,her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms
2684,2684,outstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers his
2685,2685,"hands, her arms stay up... like wings."
2686,2686,                                   JACK
2687,2687,Okay. Open them.
2688,2688,Rose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's like
2689,2689,"there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. The"
2690,2690,"Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky."
2691,2691,"There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below."

2693,2693,I'm flying!

2698,2698,Come Josephine in my flying machine...
2699,2699,"Rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the"
2700,2700,"sea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against"
2701,2701,his chest. He pushes forward slightly against her.
2702,2702,"Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers..."
2703,2703,"fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly,"
2704,2704,their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two
2705,2705,lovers.
2706,2706,"Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her"
2707,2707,"wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear."
2708,2708,"Rose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms,"
2709,2709,"turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his arms"
2710,2710,"around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and"
2711,2711,"tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They"
2712,2712,"kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion."
2713,2713,"Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism,"
2714,2714,"lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into"

2896,2896,quickly along the corridor toward the B deck foyer. They are halfway across
2897,2897,the open space when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoy
2898,2898,comes out. The valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them.
2899,2899,                                   ROSE
2900,2900,Come on!
2901,2901,"She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemen"
2902,2902,about. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They run
2903,2903,"into one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR."

2905,2905,"Take us down. Quickly, quickly!"
2906,2906,The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate.
2907,2907,Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on the
2908,2908,"bars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs"
2909,2909,as Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her.
2910,2910,

2914,2914,in. The Operator is just closing the gate to go back up. Lovejoy runs
2915,2915,around the bank of elevators and scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. He
2916,2916,tries the stairs going down to F-Deck.
2917,2917,

2929,2929,Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh!
2930,2930,Lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He charges toward
2931,2931,them. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is one
2932,2932,"door, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open."
2933,2933,"115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down."
2934,2934,"Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it a"
2935,2935,"moment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder."

2942,2942,"is like a vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and black"
2943,2943,"figures moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room,"
2944,2944,"dodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal."

2947,2947,Carry on! Don't mind us!
2948,2948,They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pulls
2949,2949,her through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in
2950,2950,"the dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, they"
2951,2951,"see the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into the"

3176,3176,134 FROM THE BRIDGE Murdoch watches the burg growing... straight ahead. The
3177,3177,bow finally starts to come left (since the ship turns the reverse of the
3178,3178,helm setting).
3179,3179,MURDOCH'S jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing slowness. He holds
3180,3180,his breath as the horrible physics play out.
3181,3181,135 IN THE CROW'S NEST Frederick Fleet braces himself.
3182,3182,136 THE BOW OF THE SHIP thunders right at CAMERA and--
3183,3183,KRUUUNCH!! The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow.
3184,3184,137 UNDERWATER we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. The
3185,3185,iceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as the
3186,3186,steel plate of the hull flexes under the load.
3187,3187,138 IN #2 HOLD the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet
3188,3188,with a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along outside the
3189,3189,"ship, the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in, sweeping them"
3190,3190,off their feert. The icy water swirls around the Renault as the men
3191,3191,scramble for the stairs.
3192,3192,139 ON G-DECK forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. He
3193,3193,hears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice.
3194,3194,140 IN BOILER ROOM SIX Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLING
3195,3195,THUNDER of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship buckle in
3196,3196,toward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water coming
3197,3197,in about two feet above the floor.
3198,3198,141 ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up in
3199,3199,"astonishment as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain."
3200,3200,"Fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and they have to jump"
3201,3201,back to avoid flying chunks of ice.
3202,3202,142 ON THE BRIDGE Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quicky throws
3203,3203,the switch that closes them.

3207,3207,143 BARRETT AND HESKETH hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through the
3208,3208,swirling water to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. The
3209,3209,room is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces.
3210,3210,Barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes down
3211,3211,like a slow guillotine.

3213,3213,Go Lads! Go! Go!
3214,3214,He dives through into Boiler Room 5 just before the door rumbles down with
3215,3215,a CLANG.
3216,3216,144 JACK AND ROSE rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving
3217,3217,aft down the side of the ship.

3361,3361,                                   BELL
3362,3362,"That's it, lads. Get the hell up!"
3363,3363,They scramble up the escape ladders.
3364,3364,

3367,3367,"The gentlemen, now joined by another man, leans on the forward rail"
3368,3368,watching the steerage men playing soccer with chunks of ice.
3369,3369,                                 GENTLEMAN
3370,3370,I guess it's nothing too serious. I'm going back to my cabin to read.
3371,3371,A 20ish YALE MAN pops through the door wearing a topcoat over pajamas.
3372,3372,                                   YALEY
3373,3373,"Say, did I miss the fun?"
3374,3374,"Rose and Jack come up the steps from the well deck, which are right next to"
3375,3375,the three men. They stare as the couple climbs over the locked gate.
3376,3376,"A moment later Captain Smith rounds the corner, followed by Andrews and"
3377,3377,Carpenter Hutchinson. They have come down from the bridge by the outside
3378,3378,"stairs. The three men, their faces grim, crush right past Jack and Rose."
3379,3379,Andrews barely glances at her.
3380,3380,                                   SMITH
3381,3381,Can you shore up?
3382,3382,                                HUTCHINSON
3383,3383,Not unless the pumps get ahead.
3384,3384,The inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck.

3386,3386,"                               (low, to her)"
3387,3387,It's bad.
3388,3388,                                   ROSE
3389,3389,We have to tell Mother and Cal.
3390,3390,                                   JACK
3391,3391,Now it's worse.
3392,3392,                                   ROSE
3393,3393,"Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?"
3394,3394,                                   JACK
3395,3395,Right.
3396,3396,Jack follows Rose through the door inside the ship.

3403,3403,We've been looking for you miss.
3404,3404,"Lovejoy follows and, unseen, moves close behind Jack and smoothly slips the"

3411,3411,closes her robe at her throat when she sees Jack.
3412,3412,                                   ROSE
3413,3413,Something serious has happened.
3414,3414,                                    CAL
3415,3415,That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that
3416,3416,one is back...
3417,3417,                       (he looks from Rose to Jack)
3418,3418,... I have a pretty good idea where to fine the other.
3419,3419,                            (to Master at Arms)
3420,3420,Search him.
3421,3421,The Master at Arms steps up to Jack.
3422,3422,                              MASTER AT ARMS
3423,3423,"Coat off, mate."
3424,3424,"Lovejoy pulls at Jack's coat and Jack shakes his head in dismay, shrugging"
3425,3425,out of it. The Master at Arms pats him down.
3426,3426,                                   JACK
3427,3427,This is horseshit.

3429,3429,"Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you--"

3437,3437,                              MASTER AT ARMS
3438,3438,Right then. Now don't make a fuss.
3439,3439,He starts to handcuff Jack.
3440,3440,                                   JACK
3441,3441,"Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!"

3446,3446,Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized the

3448,3448,"FLASHBACK: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyes"
3449,3449,"as he stands behind her, watching."

3455,3455,                                   JACK
3456,3456,They put it in my pocket!

3461,3461,"\""Property of A. L. Ryerson\""."
3462,3462,Lovejoy shows the coat to the Master at Arms. There is a label inside the
3463,3463,collar with the owner's name.
3464,3464,                              MASTER AT ARMS
3465,3465,That was reported stolen today.
3466,3466,                                   JACK
3467,3467,I was going to return it! Rose--
3468,3468,"Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him."
3469,3469,He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him out
3470,3470,into the hall. She can't look him in the eye.
3471,3471,                                   JACK
3472,3472,"Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know"
3473,3473,it!
3474,3474,She is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te
3475,3475,tears well up.

3480,3480, MAIL SORTING ROOM / HOLD
3481,3481,Smith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds
3482,3482,the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiously
3483,3483,hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below.
3484,3484,"Andrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full."
3485,3485,"Sacks of mail float everywhere. The lights are still on below the surface,"
3486,3486,"casting an eerie glow. The Renault is visible under the water, the brass"
3487,3487,"glinting cheerfully. Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, and"
3488,3488,scrambles back up the stairs.
3489,3489,

3491,3491, BRIDE / CHARTROOM
3492,3492,Andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. It is
3493,3493,"a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. His hands are"
3494,3494,shaking. Murdoch and Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain.
3495,3495,                                   ISMAY
3496,3496,"When can we get underway, do you think?"
3497,3497,Smith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing. The
3498,3498,builder points to it for emphasis as he talks.
3499,3499,                                  ANDREWS
3500,3500,Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all
3501,3501,three holds... and in boiler room six.
3502,3502,                                   SMITH
3503,3503,That's right.
3504,3504,                                  ANDREWS
3505,3505,Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments
3506,3506,breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water
3507,3507,will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the
3508,3508,next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
3509,3509,                                   SMITH
3510,3510,The pumps--
3511,3511,                                  ANDREWS
3512,3512,"The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter"
3513,3513,"what we do, Titanic will founder."
3514,3514,                                   ISMAY
3515,3515,But this ship can't sink!
3516,3516,                                  ANDREWS
3517,3517,"She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a"
3518,3518,mathematical certainty.
3519,3519,Smith looks like he has been gutpunched.
3520,3520,                                   SMITH
3521,3521,How much time?
3522,3522,                                  ANDREWS
3523,3523,"An hour, two at most."
3524,3524,Ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare.
3525,3525,                                   SMITH
3526,3526,"And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?"
3527,3527,                                  MURDOCH
3528,3528,"Two thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir."
3529,3529,A long beat. Smith turns to his employer.
3530,3530,                                   SMITH
3531,3531,"I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay."
3532,3532,

3534,3534, BOAT DECK
3535,3535,"Andrews is striding along the boat deck, as seamen and officers scurry to"
3536,3536,"uncover the boats. Steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, and"
3537,3537,the din is horrendous. Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level of
3538,3538,disorganization. Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one
3539,3539,of the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam.
3540,3540,                                  ANDREWS
3541,3541,Turn to the right! Pull the falls taut before you unchock. Have you never
3542,3542,had a boat drill?
3543,3543,                                  SEAMAN
3544,3544,"No sir! Not with these new davits, sir."
3545,3545,"He looks around, disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits, and the"
3546,3546,"tackle for the \""falls\""... the ropes which are used to lower the boats. A"
3547,3547,"few passengers are coming out on deck, hesitantly in the noise and bitter"
3548,3548,cold.
3549,3549,

3555,3555,I had better go dress.
3556,3556,"Ruth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose. He regards her coldly for a moment,"
3557,3557,then SLAPS her across the face.
3558,3558,                                    CAL
3559,3559,"It is a little slut, isn't it?"
3560,3560,To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been
3561,3561,given. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly.
3562,3562,                                    CAL
3563,3563,"Look at me, you little--"
3564,3564,There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens and
3565,3565,their steward puts his head in.
3566,3566,                              STEWARD BARNES
3567,3567,"Sir, I've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come up"
3568,3568,to the boat deck.
3569,3569,                                    CAL
3570,3570,Get out. We're busy.
3571,3571,"The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a"

3573,3573,                                  STEWARD
3574,3574,"I'm sorry about the inconvenience, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders."
3575,3575,"Please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight."
3576,3576,                       (he hands a lifebelt to Rose)
3577,3577,"Not to worry, miss, I'm sure it's just a precaution."
3578,3578,                                    CAL
3579,3579,This is ridiculous.
3580,3580,In the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequious
3581,3581,"they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. However, it's another"
3582,3582,story in...
3583,3583,

3585,3585, STEERAGE BERTHING AFT
3586,3586,BLACKNESS. Then BANG! The door is thrown open and the lights snapped on by
3587,3587,a steward. The Cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep.
3588,3588,                                STEWARD #2
3589,3589,Everybody up. Let's go. Put your lifebelts on.
3590,3590,"IN THE CORRIDOR outside, another steward is going from door to door along"
3591,3591,"the hall, pouncing and yelling."

3593,3593,"Lifebelts on. Lifebelts on. Everybody up, come on. Lifebelts on..."
3594,3594,"People come out of the doors behind the steward, perplexed. In the"
3595,3595,foreground a SYRIAN WOMAN asks her husband what was said. He shrugs.

3603,3603,That's right. The distress call. CQD. Tell whoever responds that we are
3604,3604,going down by the head and need immediate assistance.
3605,3605,Smith hurries out.
3606,3606,                                 PHILLIPS
3607,3607,Blimey.

3609,3609,Maybe you ought to try that new distress call... S.O.S.

3617,3617,Thomas Andrews looks around in amazement. The deck is empty except for the
3618,3618,crew fumbling with the davits. He yells over the roar of the steam to First
3619,3619,Officer Murdoch.
3620,3620,                                  ANDREWS

3623,3623,They've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them.
3624,3624,Andrews feels like he is in a bad dream. He looks at his pocketwatch and
3625,3625,heads for the foyer entrance.
3626,3626,

3628,3628, A-DECK FOYER
3629,3629,A large number of First Class passengers have gathered near the staircase.
3630,3630,They are getting indignant about the confusion. Molly Brown snags a passing
3631,3631,YOUNG STEWARD.
3632,3632,                                   MOLLY
3633,3633,"What's doing, sonny? You've got us all trussed up and now we're cooling our"

3637,3637,"Sorry, mum. Let me go and find out."
3638,3638,"The jumpy piano rhythm of \""Alexander's Ragtime Band\"" comes out of the first"
3639,3639,class lounge a few yards away. Band leader WALLACE HARTLEY has assembled
3640,3640,"some of his men on Captain's orders, to allay panic."
3641,3641,Hockley's entourage comes up to the A-deck foyer. Cal is carrying the

3649,3649,get back.
3650,3650,"Thomas Andrews enters, looking around the magnificent room, which he knows"
3651,3651,"is doomed. Rose, standing nearby, sees his heartbroken expression. She"
3652,3652,walks over to him and Cal goes after her.
3653,3653,                                   ROSE
3654,3654,"I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me"
3655,3655,the truth.

3665,3665,                                  ANDREWS
3666,3666,"Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic."
3667,3667,And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about
3668,3668,the boats?

3708,3708,Lightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd of
3709,3709,uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. One first class
3710,3710,woman is barefoot. Others are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is
3711,3711,"in top hat and overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are"
3712,3712,"in bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns,"
3713,3713,"then topping it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, even"
3714,3714,small dogs.
3715,3715,Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him.
3716,3716,"He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the"
3717,3717,steam...
3718,3718,                                LIGHTOLLER
3719,3719,"Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?"
3720,3720,"Smith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of him. Lightoller"
3721,3721,sees the awesome truth in Smith's face.

3723,3723,                               (to the men)
3724,3724,Right! Start the loading. Women and children!
3725,3725,"The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden"
3726,3726,unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes.
3727,3727,ON WALLACE HARTLEY raising his violin to play.
3728,3728,                                  HARTLEY

3730,3730,"The band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side,"
3731,3731,near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. They strike up
3732,3732,"a waltz, lively and elegant. The music wafts all over the ship."
3733,3733,                                LIGHTOLLER
3734,3734,"Ladies, please. Step into the boat."

3743,3743,"She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing to"
3744,3744,let her go. The firmness of his hold surprises her.

3762,3762,"suitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him."
3763,3763,Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. There is a

3765,3765,on the other side.

4119,4119,"the axe, running back the way she came."
4120,4120,192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the
4121,4121,bottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along the
4122,4122,corridor to the room where Jack is trapped.
4123,4123,"Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powers"
4124,4124,"forward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at the"

4452,4452,Seamen SCAROTT brandishes the tiller of boat 14 to discourage a close press
4453,4453,of men who look ready to rush the boat. Several men break ranks and rush
4454,4454,forward.
4455,4455,Lightoller pulls out his Webley revolver and aims it at them.

4472,4472,to be quite... practical.
4473,4473,"215 IN THE WATER BELOW there is another panic. Boat 13, already in the"

4475,4475,"being pumped out of the ship. It winds up directly under boat 15, which is"
4476,4476,coming downt he right on top of it.
4477,4477,The passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering. They are
4478,4478,"ignored. Some men put their hands up, trying futilely to keep the 5 tons of"
4479,4479,boat 15 from crushing them.
4480,4480,"Fred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls,"
4481,4481,climbing rudely over people. He cuts the aft falls while another crewman
4482,4482,cuts the forward lines. 13 drifts out from beneath 15 just seconds before

4629,4629,stepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur.
4630,4630,                                LIGHTOLLER
4631,4631,Lower away!
4632,4632,The two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend.

4637,4637,Almost as good as you.

4641,4641,Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by
4642,4642,morning.
4643,4643,"Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste a"
4644,4644,second of his last view of her.
4645,4645,222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through the
4646,4646,pulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightoller
4647,4647,"giving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in"
4648,4648,her ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in
4649,4649,"slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing in"
4650,4650,"slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees"
4651,4651,"his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot"
4652,4652,believe the unbearable pain she is feeling...
4653,4653,"Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face."
4654,4654,SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reaches
4655,4655,"the gunwale, climbing it..."
4656,4656,"Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catching"
4657,4657,"it, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose is"
4658,4658,back on Titanic.
4659,4659,                                   JACK

4664,4664,thought.
4665,4665,

4669,4669,"down the stairs. He sees her coming into A-deck foyer, running toward him,"
4670,4670,Cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs.
4671,4671,"They meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace."
4672,4672,                                   JACK
4673,4673,"Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--"
4674,4674,And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can.
4675,4675,                                   ROSE
4676,4676,"You jump, I jump, right?"
4677,4677,                                   JACK
4678,4678,Right.
4679,4679,Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them locked
4680,4680,in their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HAND
4681,4681,"on him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband"
4682,4682,in one cobra-fast move.
4683,4683,He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing above
4684,4684,"them he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES."
4685,4685,The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pulls
4686,4686,"Rose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again,"
4687,4687,running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oak
4688,4688,panelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of
4689,4689,stairs.
4690,4690,Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes
4691,4691,"sprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, and"
4692,4692,reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.
4693,4693,

4696,4696,The bottom of the grand staircase is flooded several feet deep. Jack and
4697,4697,"Rose come down the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water,"
4698,4698,"fording across the room to where the floor slopes up, until they reach dry"
4699,4699,footing at the entrance to the dining saloon.
4700,4700,STEADICAM WITH HOCKLEY as he reels down the stairs in time to see Jack and
4701,4701,Rose splashing through the water toward the dining saloon. He FIRES twice.
4702,4702,"Big gouts of spray near them, but he's not a great shot."
4703,4703,The water boils up around his feet and he retreast up the stairs a couple
4704,4704,of steps. Around him the woodward groans and creaks.
4705,4705,                                    CAL
4706,4706,                             (calling to them)
4707,4707,Enjoy your time together!!
4708,4708,Lovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something and starts to
4709,4709,laugh.
4710,4710,                                  LOVEJOY
4711,4711,What could possible be funny?
4712,4712,                                    CAL
4713,4713,I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
4714,4714,"He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering."
4715,4715,                                    CAL
4716,4716,I give it to you... if you can get it.
4717,4717,He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. Lovejoy thinks
4718,4718,about it... then slogs into the water. The icewater is up to his waist as
4719,4719,he crosses the pool into the dining saloon.
4720,4720,

4723,4723,"Lovejoy moves among the tables and ornate columns, searching..."
4724,4724,"listening... his eyes tracking rapidly. It is a sea of tables, and they"
4725,4725,"could be anywhere. A silver serving tolley rolls downhill, bumping into"
4726,4726,tables and pillars.
4727,4727,"He glances behind him. The water is following him into the room, advancing"
4728,4728,"in a hundred foot wide tide. The reception room is now a roiling lake, and"
4729,4729,the grand staircase is submerged past the first landing. Monstrous groans
4730,4730,echo through the ship.
4731,4731,"ON JACK AND ROSE, crouched behind a table, somewhere in the middle. They"
4732,4732,"see the water advancing toward them, swirling over the floor. They crawl"
4733,4733,ahead of it to the next row of tables.
4734,4734,                                   JACK
4735,4735,                               (whispering)
4736,4736,Stay here.
4737,4737,He moves off as--
4738,4738,Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. Nothing.
4739,4739,The ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row.
4740,4740,ANGLE ON A METAL CART... five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes.
4741,4741,It starts to roll down the aisle between tables.
4742,4742,ON ROSE as the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks of
4743,4743,"dishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering her."
4744,4744,She scrambles out of the way and--
4745,4745,"Lovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gun"
4746,4746,aimed--
4747,4747,That's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together into a
4748,4748,"table, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. They land in the water"
4749,4749,which is flowing rapidly between the tables.
4750,4750,Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his knee down on
4751,4751,"Lovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away. Lovejoy"
4752,4752,"scrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack GUTPUCHES him right in the solar"
4753,4753,"plexus, doubling him over."
4754,4754,                                   JACK
4755,4755,Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.
4756,4756,He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb. Lovejoy drops to the
4757,4757,"floor with a splas, stunned."
4758,4758,                                   JACK
4759,4759,Let's go.
4760,4760,Jack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind them the
4761,4761,tables have become islands in a lake... and the far end of the room is
4762,4762,flooded up to the ceiling.
4763,4763,Lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up out of the
4764,4764,water and wades after them.
4765,4765,

4768,4768,They run throught the galley and Rose spots the stairs. She starts up and
4769,4769,Jack grabs her hand. He leads her DOWN.
4770,4770,They crouch together on the landing as Lovejoy runs to the stairs. Assuming
4771,4771,they have gone up (who wouldn't?) he clombs up them two at a time.
4772,4772,They wait for the footstep to recede. A long CREAKING GROAN. Then they hear
4773,4773,it... a CRYING CHILD. Below them. They go down a frew steps to looks along
4774,4774,the next deck.
4775,4775,

4779,4779,"50 feet away, is a little BOY, aobut 3. The water swirls around his legs"
4780,4780,and he is wailing.
4781,4781,                                   ROSE
4782,4782,We can't leave him.
4783,4783,Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to
4784,4784,the child. Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but--
4785,4785,A torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. In seconds it
4786,4786,is too powerful for them to go against.
4787,4787,                                   JACK
4788,4788,Come on.
4789,4789,"Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray with"
4790,4790,each footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy double doors. As Jack
4791,4791,approaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors
4792,4792,right up to the ceiling. The doors groan and start to crack under the tons
4793,4793,of pressure.
4794,4794,                                   JACK
4795,4795,Back! Go back!!
4796,4796,"Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into a"
4797,4797,cross-corridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He sees the boy in Jack's
4798,4798,"arms and cries out, grabbing him away from Jack. Starts cursing him in"
4799,4799,Russian. He runs on with the boy--
4800,4800,                                   ROSE
4801,4801,No! Not that way! Come back!
4802,4802,228 DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the corridor.
4803,4803,The father and child DISAPPEAR instantly.
4804,4804,"Jack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor to"
4805,4805,ceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. They make it to a stairway
4806,4806,going up.

4812,4812,"against the fate, gripping the bars."
4813,4813,A terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns to run at the
4814,4814,sight of the water thundering up the stairs.
4815,4815,                                   JACK
4816,4816,Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.
4817,4817,"The steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, pouring"
4818,4818,through the gate and slamming them against it. In seconds it is up to their

4822,4822,"The steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at the gate, their"

4826,4826,Fucking 'ell!
4827,4827,"He runs back, slogging against the curretn. He pulls a key ring from his"
4828,4828,belt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up around
4829,4829,them.
4830,4830,The lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness.
4831,4831,The water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel.

4844,4844,"CAL'S POV: A little girl, maybe two years old, is crying along in the"

4960,4960,"WHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleaming"
4961,4961,brass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse.
4962,4962,238 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pulls
4963,4963,out his pocketwatch and checks the time. Then he opens the face of the
4964,4964,mantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything must

4984,4984,"frantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't drag"
4985,4985,it under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he saws
4986,4986,"furiously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, still"

4988,4988,with it.
4989,4989,"244 IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he has"

4998,4998,and a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. He
4999,4999,disappears in a vortex of foam.
5000,5000,246 Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. It
5001,5001,"partially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. Over a hundred"
5002,5002,passengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boat

5172,5172,265 AT THE STERN the propellers are 100 feet out of the water and rising.
5173,5173,"Panicking people leap from the poop deck rail, fall screaming and hit the"

5178,5178,"267 AT THE STERN RAIL a man jumps. IN HIS POV we fall seemingly forever,"
5179,5179,right past one of the giant screws. The water rushes up--

5200,5200,"hand-torches. It is a black hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, and"
5201,5201,groaning machinery threatening to tear right out of its bedplates.
5202,5202,"Water sprays down, hitting the breaker panel, but Bell will not leave his"

5219,5219,Near the third funnel a man clutches the ship's rail. He stares down as the
5220,5220,DECK SPLITS right between his feet. A yawning chasm opens with a THUNDER of
5221,5221,breaking steel
5222,5222,LOVEJOY is clutching the railing on the roof of the Officers' Mess. He
5223,5223,watches in horror as the ship's structure RIPS APART right in front of him.
5224,5224,"He gapes down into a widening maw, seeing straight down into the bowels of"
5225,5225,"the ship, amid a BOOMING CONCUSSION like the sound of artillery. People"
5226,5226,falling into the widening crevasse look like dolls.
5227,5227,"The stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks like whips,"
5228,5228,ripping off davits and ventilators. A man is hit by a whipping cable and
5229,5229,snatched OUT OF FRAME. Another cable smashes the rail next to Lovejoy and
5230,5230,it rips free. He falls backward into the pit of jagged metal.
5231,5231,"Fires, explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the hull splits"
5232,5232,down through nine decks to the keel. The sea pours into the gaping wound--

5242,5242, TITANIC - NIGHT
5243,5243,"The STERN ALF of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, falls back toward"
5244,5244,the water. On the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselves
5245,5245,plummeting. The sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium
5246,5246,when a run is scored.
5247,5247,Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as
5248,5248,they see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massive
5249,5249,"stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and"
5250,5250,pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water.
5251,5251,Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the ship
5252,5252,seemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation.
5253,5253,                              SEVERAL PEOPLE
5254,5254,We're saved!
5255,5255,"Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly."
5256,5256,Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight of
5257,5257,"the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF"
5258,5258,"ASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches,"
5259,5259,"railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts."
5260,5260,"The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty."
5261,5261,"People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck,"
5262,5262,screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other people
5263,5263,loose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at the
5264,5264,forward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one.
5265,5265,                                   JACK
5266,5266,We have to move!
5267,5267,He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified
5268,5268,to move. He grabs her hand.
5269,5269,                                   JACK
5270,5270,Come on! I've got you!
5271,5271,Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the
5272,5272,"rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as"
5273,5273,"the railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her"
5274,5274,fiercely.
5275,5275,The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith
5276,5276,"standing against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note,"
5277,5277,its buoyancy stable.
5278,5278,"Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea"
5279,5279,"at the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over,"
5280,5280,"hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall"
5281,5281,"one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of"
5282,5282,them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.
5283,5283,"Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull,"
5284,5284,"gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are"
5285,5285,the gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern.
5286,5286,Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them.
5287,5287,"Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull,"
5288,5288,holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment.
5289,5289,                                  JOUGHIN
5290,5290,                           (nodding a greeting)
5291,5291,Helluva night.
5292,5292,The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Looking
5293,5293,"down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and"
5294,5294,Rose.
5295,5295,                                   JACK
5296,5296,                              (talking fast)
5297,5297,Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship
5298,5298,will suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of
5299,5299,my hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me.
5300,5300,"She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder."
5301,5301,                                   ROSE
5302,5302,I trust you.
5303,5303,Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the
5304,5304,boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last
5305,5305,thirty feet.
5306,5306,"278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name"
5307,5307,"TITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the"
5308,5308,water.
5309,5309,"Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean."

5316,5316, FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holding
5317,5317,"tightly to Rose, pulling her up."
5318,5318,"281 AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a"
5319,5319,thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some are
5320,5320,"stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning,"
5321,5321,shouting... screaming.
5322,5322,Jack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for air
5323,5323,"before people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, 4"
5324,5324,"degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form"

5326,5326,"A man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly"

5331,5331,"She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her"

5333,5333,"of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water."

5359,5359,What's that?
5360,5360,"Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a"

5363,5363,"But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges,"

5524,5524,"trail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of a"

5530,5530,Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the oars on the

5540,5540,"The stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to be"
5541,5541,floating in interstellar space. They are absolutely still. Their hands are
5542,5542,locked together. Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling
5543,5543,"above her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep steals"
5544,5544,"over Rose, and she feels peace."
5545,5545,"CLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to be"
5546,5546,floating in a void. Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state. She knows she is
5547,5547,dying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song:
5548,5548,                                   ROSE
5549,5549,"\""Come Josephine in my flying machine...\"""
5550,5550,ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way a
5551,5551,glorious band from horizon to horizon.
5552,5552,A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.
5553,5553,TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals.
5554,5554,"Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track down"
5555,5555,from the stars to the water.
5556,5556,ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars.
5557,5557,"She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water,"
5558,5558,leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men sound
5559,5559,slow and DISTORTED.
5560,5560,Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across
5561,5561,"the water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past her"
5562,5562,"motionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past"
5563,5563,her. The men look away.
5564,5564,Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to the
5565,5565,wood under her.

5568,5568,Jack.
5569,5569,She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose
5570,5570,gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost.
5571,5571,He seems to be sleeping peacefully.
5572,5572,But he is not asleep.
5573,5573,Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her.
5574,5574,                                   ROSE
5575,5575,"Oh, Jack."
5576,5576,"All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further"
5577,5577,"away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go."
5578,5578,"She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason"
5579,5579,to even try.
5580,5580,And then... her eyes snap open.
5581,5581,"She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the"
5582,5582,"wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat"
5583,5583,"is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles"
5584,5584,"to draw breath, calling again."
5585,5585,292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something
5586,5586,"ahead, turning the tiller."
5587,5587,"293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to"
5588,5588,"Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps"
5589,5589,"their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film."
5590,5590,                                   ROSE
5591,5591,I won't let go. I promise.
5592,5592,She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out
5593,5593,like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.
5594,5594,Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She
5595,5595,swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to
5596,5596,BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across
5597,5597,the still water.
5598,5598,294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.

5602,5602,Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowe
5603,5603,takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slips
5604,5604,into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets...

5706,5706,"That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited"
5707,5707,"his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol"
5708,5708,in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate

5732,5732,forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium

5805,5805,Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. Rose keeps it
5806,5806,over the railing where she can drop it anytime.

5814,5814,She stares at it in amazement.

5817,5817,"The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I"
5818,5818,"though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without"
5819,5819,his help.
5820,5820,She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys come
5821,5821,"up behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand."

5834,5834,"the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is..."
5835,5835,"we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about"

5837,5837,                                   ROSE
5838,5838,I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs.
5839,5839,The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand...

5841,5841,"Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once."
5842,5842,He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to her
5843,5843,at the stern of Titanic.
5844,5844,"Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand,"
5845,5845,while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of his
5846,5846,quest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is
5847,5847,mesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined.
5848,5848,                                  LOVETT
5849,5849,My God.
5850,5850,His grip tightens on the diamond.
5851,5851,"He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and"

5855,5855,"priceless, and making each day count."
5856,5856,His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond out
5857,5857,of his hand. He feels it sliding away.
5858,5858,"Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail."
5859,5859,Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit
5860,5860,the water and disappear forever.
5861,5861,                                  BODINE
5862,5862,"Aww!! That really sucks, lady!"
5863,5863,Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HE
5864,5864,LAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy.

5866,5866,Would you like to dance?
5867,5867,Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.

5879,5879,"THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at the"
