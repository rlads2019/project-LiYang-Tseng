"3",3,"     The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky."
"4",4,"     The church bell rings, resonating."
"5",5,"     Mass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt"
"6",6,"     road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on"
"7",7,"     foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story"

"10",10,"  OLD HOUSE  DAY"
"11",11,"     Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than"
"12",12,"     bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty"
"13",13,"     second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn"
"14",14,"     wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls."
"15",15,"     Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled"
"16",16,"     away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger"
"17",17,"     across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper."
"18",18,"     He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly."
"19",19,"     He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a"
"20",20,"     roughly squared section with the rose at its center."
"21",21,"     He studies it in his hand."

"24",24,"     Birds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape."

"26",26,"                   Is something wrong?"
"27",27,"     Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real"
"28",28,"     estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford"
"29",29,"     Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts."

"51",51,"     The man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the"

"54",54,"                   That is exactly what I mean.  Strange."
"55",55,"     Somerset looks back at the house.  The man does not understand."

"57",57,"  AMTRACK TRAIN  DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)"
"58",58,"     Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out"
"59",59,"     the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from"
"60",60,"     the few other passengers."
"61",61,"     Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama"
"62",62,"     is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun."
"63",63,"     The light flickers across Somerset's placid face."
"64",64,"     "
"65",65,"  AMTRACK TRAIN  LATER DAY"
"66",66,"     The train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the"
"67",67,"     aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his"
"68",68,"     lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has"
"69",69,"     soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field."
"70",70,"     A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little"
"71",71,"     further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their"
"72",72,"     coats matted with blood."
"73",73,"     Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs."
"74",74,"     Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight."
"75",75,"     "
"76",76,"  AMTRACK TRAIN  EARLY EVENING"
"77",77,"     Passing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People"
"78",78,"     stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps."
"79",79,"     Somerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the"
"80",80,"     aisle seat, reading his book."
"81",81,"     "
"82",82,"  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT  LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)"
"83",83,"     Curtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will"
"84",84,"     be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's"
"85",85,"     life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a"
"86",86,"     closet and hundreds of books on shelves."
"87",87,"     Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed."
"88",88,"     He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical"
"89",89,"     metronome."
"90",90,"     He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and"
"91",91,"     forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK."
"92",92,"     Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady."
"93",93,"     Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's"
"94",94,"     ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's"
"95",95,"     face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome."
"96",96,"     His eyes close tighter."
"97",97,"     Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's"
"98",98,"     breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER."
"99",99,"     Tick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration."
"100",100,"     The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes"
"101",101,"     slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick..."

"103",103,"  CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS  NIGHT"
"104",104,"     DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is"
"105",105,"     a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always"
"106",106,"     smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated"
"107",107,"     storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway"
"108",108,"     tracks.  A train roars overhead."
"109",109,"     Mills watches it as he walks on."
"110",110,"     Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,"
"111",111,"     throwing his shadow long down the deserted street."
"112",112,"     "
"113",113,"  URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES  NIGHT"
"114",114,"     This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat"
"115",115,"     skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and"
"116",116,"     pieces of junk in the gutter."
"117",117,"     Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to"
"118",118,"     break into the trunk of a parked car."
"119",119,"     Mills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will"
"120",120,"     be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm."
"121",121,"                                 MILLS"
"122",122,"                   Is that your car, man?"
"123",123,"                                 FIRST THUG"
"124",124,"                   What the fuck do you care?"
"125",125,"     Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand."
"126",126,"                                 MILLS"
"127",127,"                   Does that car belong to you?"
"128",128,"     The thugs look at each other, gauging.  They face Mills."
"129",129,"                                 FIRST THUG"
"130",130,"                   Yeah, it's my car, alright?  Fuck off."
"131",131,"                                 MILLS"
"132",132,"                   You're telling me that's your car?"
"133",133,"     The second thug starts the long way round the car."
"134",134,"                                 SECOND THUG"
"135",135,"                   Well, for some strange reason, I don't"
"136",136,"                   believe you."
"137",137,"     Mills gives a \""isn't that silly\"" laugh, shifts his gaze "
"138",138,"     Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon."
"139",139,"                                 FIRST THUG"
"140",140,"                           (steps forward)"
"141",141,"                   You can fucking suck my..."
"142",142,"     Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle"
"143",143,"     against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly."
"144",144,"     The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife."
"145",145,"     Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the"
"146",146,"     second thug's face  CRACK.  Broken nose."
"147",147,"     The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose"
"148",148,"     squirting blood."
"149",149,"     Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard."
"150",150,"     The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one"
"151",151,"     step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away."
"152",152,"     Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when"
"153",153,"     the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards."
"154",154,"     Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold."
"155",155,"     They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning."
"156",156,"     Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one"
"157",157,"     knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car."
"158",158,"     Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair"
"159",159,"     and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills'"
"160",160,"     free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice  third time's"
"161",161,"     the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold."
"162",162,"     Mills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at"
"163",163,"     the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure."
"164",164,"     He takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the"
"165",165,"     car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to"
"166",166,"     collect the other thug off the street."
"167",167,"     "

"169",169,"     Somerset picks items off a moving box:  keys, wallet, homicide"

"171",171,"     From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose."

"174",174,"     A wall is stained by a starburst of blood.  Somerset stands,"
"175",175,"     melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a"
"176",176,"     sawed-off shotgun.  The apartment is gloomy.  DETECTIVE TAYLOR,"

"180",180,"                   other.  It was nothing new or unusual."
"181",181,"                   But, then they heard the gun go off."

"3380",3380,"     Mills jumps up.  He moves towards the railing.  Somerset sits up"
"3381",3381,"     and takes out his own gun.  The stairwell is silent."
"3382",3382,"     Mills peers over the railing into the stairwell's center, gun"
"3383",3383,"     pointed.  A HEAVY METALLIC CLICK is HEARD.  Echoes.  Mills leaps"
"3384",3384,"     backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by"

"3430",3430,"     Sarah and Billy wait in the hall.  Somerset hits a switch on the"

"3441",3441,"     colors.  There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water"
"3442",3442,"     colors and pastels.  Mills looks at one corner of the desk.  An"

"3496",3496,"     The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange,"

"3501",3501,"     of film from Hollywood's early days."
"3502",3502,"     Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel.  The"
"3503",3503,"     painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled"

"5649",5649,"     Tracy nods.  There's nothing left for them to say.  They're both"
"5650",5650,"     empty.  It's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug,"
"5651",5651,"     to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move."

"5667",5667,"     cross.  He stands there, looks up."
"5668",5668,"     At the city around him.  The buildings towering over him."
"5669",5669,"     At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing"

"5671",5671,"     Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope"
"5672",5672,"     from John Doe.  He studies it in his hand."

"5675",5675,"                   Oh... man..."
"5676",5676,"     He opens it.  He takes out a small note, handwritten.  It reads:"
"5677",5677,"                                          PLOW THEM UNDER."
"5678",5678,"     Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of"
"5679",5679,"     his emotions.  He looks around:"
"5680",5680,"     At the miserable people, walking past him."
"5681",5681,"     At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a"
"5682",5682,"     cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside."
"5683",5683,"     A father passes by, holding his young son's hand.  Somerset"
"5684",5684,"     turns to watch them as they pass.  The gather reaches to pick"
"5685",5685,"     the boy up and carry him.  The boy holds tight."
"5686",5686,"     For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow."
"5687",5687,"     The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek.  The"
"5688",5688,"     boy returns the kiss, with great affection."
"5689",5689,"     Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity.  He"
"5690",5690,"     looks back at the note in his hand."
"5691",5691,"     He tears the note up, into little pieces."

"5696",5696,"     She reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope."
"5697",5697,"     She opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out"
"5698",5698,"     into her palm."
"5699",5699,"     She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the"
"5700",5700,"     envelope.  She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of"
"5701",5701,"     paper.  She unfolds it:"
"5702",5702,"     It is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center."
"5703",5703,"     She smiles very faintly."
