449,449,              Francesco Solimena painted this; he
450,450,              often depicted the Volturi as Gods.

454,454,                          EDWARD
455,455,              Yes. He lived with them for a few                   
456,456,              decades. He describes them as very

480,480,A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to       
481,481,"the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either           "

490,490,"side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and        "
491,491,tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the

3825,3825,"BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets."
3826,3826,On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER;
3827,3827,it reads one minute before noon.
3828,3828,Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves
3829,3829,"back, shouting at her in Italian --"
3830,3830,                          ITALIAN MAN
3831,3831,              Fare attenzione!
3832,3832,98
3833,3833,Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by --
3834,3834,"A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!    The clock tower bells chime."
3835,3835,It's noon!
3836,3836,"Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow"
3837,3837,water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through
3838,3838,"the crowd. Finally, she SEES --"
3839,3839,BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER
3840,3840,"Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight."
3841,3841,                            BELLA
3842,3842,              Edward! --
3843,3843,-- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME.
3844,3844,"She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --"
3845,3845,CLOSE ON EDWARD (IN SLOW MOTION) - as he unbuttons his
3846,3846,"shirt, exposing his bare chest --"
3847,3847,ON BELLA (IN SLOW MOTION) - calling his name --
3848,3848,"ON EDWARD'S FACE - he closes his eyes, welcoming death --"
3849,3849,then slowly --
3850,3850,"Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his        "
3851,3851,"shoe, but before the sun touches his skin --                       "
3852,3852,BELLA SLAMS into him - it's like running into a brick wall --      
3853,3853,                            BELLA
3854,3854,"              No, Edward!    Don't!"
3855,3855,Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms
3856,3856,"its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind.            "
3857,3857,                          EDWARD

3865,3865,              Look at me!    Alice was wrong.                      
3866,3866,He begins to realize... she is real.

3871,3871,"              Please, step back.   I'm alive, I'm --"
3872,3872,"He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with"
3873,3873,her. They soak each other in like starved people suddenly
3874,3874,nourished. He pulls away to look at her...
3875,3875,                          EDWARD
3876,3876,              You're here.
3877,3877,                          BELLA
3878,3878,              I'm here.
3879,3879,"They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when"
3880,3880,"suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind"
3881,3881,"him, taking a protective stance in front of her --"
3882,3882,They face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower.
3883,3883,Out of the alley's shadows emerge --
3884,3884,TWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome
3885,3885,"males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI,             "
3886,3886,"slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES."
3887,3887,                          EDWARD
3888,3888,              I won't be needing your services after

3890,3890,                          FELIX
3891,3891,              Aro wants to speak with you again.

3893,3893,              No rules were broken.                                
3894,3894,Demetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree. He's the more
3895,3895,gracious of the two. But no less dangerous.
3896,3896,                          DEMETRI
3897,3897,              We should take this conversation to a
3898,3898,              more appropriate venue.

3917,3917,              still win.

3923,3923,"dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out"
3924,3924,from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES.
3925,3925,Felix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and           
3926,3926,"Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of        "
3927,3927,this small girl.

3936,3936,              Just do as she says.
3937,3937,Jane tosses Edward an overcoat.    He dons it.

3939,3939,              Follow me.
3940,3940,"Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll"

3946,3946,"Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow,"
3947,3947,dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward
3948,3948,never loosens his grip on Bella's hand.
3949,3949,Their path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides
3950,3950,"forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN"
3951,3951,HOLE in the street; it's a drain. Alice follows Jane.
3952,3952,"Bella looks down, sees nothing but BLACKNESS."

3962,3962,"but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach --"
3963,3963,A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.
3964,3964,They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them --

4228,4228,                            BELLA                                
4229,4229,              Didn't you?                                        
4230,4230,                          EDWARD                                 
4231,4231,              I went to them because I thought I'd               
4232,4232,              lost you.                                          
4233,4233,                          BELLA                                  
4234,4234,              You didn't even want me.                           
4235,4235,Now Edward takes her by the shoulders.

4238,4238,              protect you. I wanted you to have a

4241,4241,              But it was so easy for you to leave.               
4242,4242,                          EDWARD                                 
4243,4243,              I had to be convincing. But easy?     In

4246,4246,              through.                                           
4247,4247,She's beginning to believe him.

4249,4249,              I kept seeing you. Visions of you.                 
4250,4250,              Always protecting me. I thought I was              
4251,4251,              going crazy.

4258,4258,HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS            
4259,4259,flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone.

4298,4298,              She won't have to. There are ways to                
4299,4299,              keep the Volturi in the dark.

4302,4302,              They'll come after your whole family.
4303,4303,              You'd risk that just to keep me human?
4304,4304,                          EDWARD
4305,4305,              Just? You really don't understand

4317,4317,              You all know what Edward wants. And
4318,4318,              you know what I want. But I won't
4319,4319,              force myself on you...
4320,4320,INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CULLEN FAMILY who surround Bella. The          
4321,4321,house has been restored to it's original warmth and beauty.       
4322,4322,Edward sits off to the side as Bella addresses them.

4324,4324,              I think the only fair way to handle                 
4325,4325,              this is by vote --

4334,4334,              letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go

4338,4338,                The hell you will.   I'm not missing
4339,4339,                another fight.
4340,4340,                            BELLA
4341,4341,"                That's not up for a vote, Emmett.    I"
4342,4342,                don't want you involved.
4343,4343,                            ESME
4344,4344,"                We've always been involved, honey, and"
4345,4345,                we're not going to stop --
4346,4346,                            BELLA
4347,4347,"                No, please -- I want you to seriously"
4348,4348,"                think about this. If I join you,"
4349,4349,                you'll be stuck with me for a long
4350,4350,                time - forever. It's a huge decision.
4351,4351,                And I want - I need your honesty here.
4352,4352,They nod or otherwise communicate agreement.
4353,4353,                            BELLA
4354,4354,                Then let's take a vote... Alice?
4355,4355,Alice jumps up and hugs Bella.
4356,4356,                            ALICE
4357,4357,                Like you're not already my sister.     Of
4358,4358,"                course, yes!"
4359,4359,"Bella smiles.   Jasper rises, but keeps his distance."
4360,4360,                            JASPER
4361,4361,                I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to
4362,4362,                want to kill you.
4363,4363,                             BELLA
4364,4364,"                Um.   Thanks? Okay, Rosalie?"
4365,4365,"Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her."
4366,4366,                            ROSALIE
4367,4367,"                Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I"
4368,4368,                really am. And I know you're not
4369,4369,                ready to forgive me...
4370,4370,                     (to Bella)
4371,4371,                But this isn't the life I'd have
4372,4372,                chosen for myself. I wish there'd
4373,4373,                been someone to vote no for me...
4374,4374,                     (she exchanges a glance
4375,4375,                      with Carlisle - then...)
4376,4376,                So... no.
4377,4377,112
4378,4378,Bella takes it stoically.    Emmett bounds over and lifts           
4379,4379,Bella into a bear hug.
4380,4380,                          EMMETT
4381,4381,              I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight
4382,4382,              with these Volturi some other way.
4383,4383,Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly.
4384,4384,                          ESME
4385,4385,              I already think of you as part of the
4386,4386,              family. Yes.
4387,4387,                          BELLA
4388,4388,"              Thank you, Esme."
4389,4389,"Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --"
4390,4390,                            CARLISLE
4391,4391,              Edward --
4392,4392,                          EDWARD
4393,4393,"              You can't go along with this,"
4394,4394,"              Carlisle, you know what it means."
4395,4395,                          CARLISLE
4396,4396,"              You've chosen not to live without her,"
4397,4397,              which leaves me no choice. I won't
4398,4398,              lose my son.
4399,4399,                   (turns to Bella)
4400,4400,              But Alice has never turned anyone.
4401,4401,              It'd be safer if I did it --
