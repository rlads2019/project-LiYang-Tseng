"8",8,"               A SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a "
"9",9,"               bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of "
"10",10,"               the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. "
"11",11,"               There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--"
"12",12,"               --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we"
"13",13,"               PULL BACK TO REVEAL"
"14",14,"               PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really "
"15",15,"               a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western "
"16",16,"               themed."
"17",17,"               He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous "
"18",18,"               mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered "
"19",19,"               along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows "
"20",20,"               stronger--there could be a storm."
"21",21,"               PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he "
"22",22,"               continues to type."
"23",23,"               He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good "
"24",24,"               face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other "
"25",25,"               words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen "
"26",26,"               years and for half that time, the most recent half, a "
"27",27,"               remarkably successful one."
"28",28,"               He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a "
"29",29,"               hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another "
"30",30,"               burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--"
"31",31,"                                                                    "
"32",32,"               THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the "
"33",33,"               table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:"

"36",36,"               A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this "

"38",38,"               folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of "

"44",44,"               A SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and "
"45",45,"               pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather "
"46",46,"               briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the "
"47",47,"               briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, "
"48",48,"               and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a "
"49",49,"               child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself "
"50",50,"               a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--"
"51",51,"               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales "
"52",52,"               deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles."

"60",60,"               He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, "
"61",61,"               holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives "
"62",62,"               away."

"1259",1259,"               THE ROOM"
"1260",1260,"               PAUL lies still. He looks around the room and listens for "
"1261",1261,"               sounds. All he hears are the SOUNDS OF A WINTER NIGHT in the "
"1262",1262,"               mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and "
"1263",1263,"               then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body "
"1264",1264,"               out of bed, to make it move."
"1265",1265,"               He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the "
"1266",1266,"               main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his "
"1267",1267,"               legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly "
"1268",1268,"               he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over "
"1269",1269,"               onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor "
"1270",1270,"               by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and "
"1271",1271,"               he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way "
"1272",1272,"               to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds "
"1273",1273,"               himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to "
"1274",1274,"               the floor."
"1275",1275,"               The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he "
"1276",1276,"               slowly crawls toward the door."
"1277",1277,"               He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked. "
"1278",1278,"               He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is "
"1279",1279,"               much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the "
"1280",1280,"               bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs"
"1281",1281,"               the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes "

"1942",1942,"               notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly "
"1943",1943,"               it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the  "
"1944",1944,"               house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but "
"1945",1945,"               canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke "
"1946",1946,"               containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he "
"1947",1947,"               notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees "
"1948",1948,"               all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of "
"1949",1949,"               strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and "
"1950",1950,"               stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry "
"1951",1951,"               door and heads to the kitchen."

"1955",1955,"               has trouble."
"1956",1956,"               He backs up slightly, wheels forward again--"
"1957",1957,"               --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. "

"1969",1969,"               have the strength to maneuver properly--"
"1970",1970,"               --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard "
"1971",1971,"               against the hard floor."

"1973",1973,"               PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a "
"1974",1974,"               moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He "
"1975",1975,"               is hurting."
"1976",1976,"               He closes his eyes, gathering strength--"
"1977",1977,"               --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his "
"1978",1978,"               body across the floor toward the kitchen door."

"1987",1987,"               PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is "
"1988",1988,"               just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and "
"1989",1989,"               up and grabs the doorknob--"

"1993",1993,"               PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his "
"1994",1994,"               face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting "
"1995",1995,"               from his effort. Then--"
"1996",1996,"                                                                    "
"1997",1997,"               PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his "

"2002",2002,"               They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He "
"2003",2003,"               starts to crawl over to the counter."

"2011",2011,"               to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the "
"2012",2012,"               knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing "

"2945",2945,"               clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article: "
"2946",2946,"               simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes."
"2947",2947,"               PAUL turns the page. This headline reads: \""Investment Banker "

"2949",2949,"               \""USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall.\"" That's the headline "

"2955",2955,"               Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--\""after "
"2956",2956,"               long illness\"" is from the next article. \""Long illness\"" from "
"2957",2957,"               the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: "

"2964",2964,"               PAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states "
"2965",2965,"               keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota, "
"2966",2966,"               Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting "
"2967",2967,"               deaths and deaths and--"

"2981",2981,"               under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes."

"2995",2995,"               table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we"

"2997",2997,"               PAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries "
"2998",2998,"               to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he "
"2999",2999,"               can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too "
"3000",3000,"               cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his "
"3001",3001,"               room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles "
"3002",3002,"               into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his "
"3003",3003,"               chest and stares up at the ceiling."
"3004",3004,"                                                               DISSOLVE TO:"

"3007",3007,"               PAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears "
"3008",3008,"               something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP."
"3009",3009,"               HEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL "
"3010",3010,"               grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of "
"3011",3011,"               a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS."
"3012",3012,"               As the FRONT DOOR OPENS, PAUL girds himself for attack. THE "
"3013",3013,"               FRONT DOOR CLOSES, then a couple of FOOTSTEPS. Then silence. "
"3014",3014,"               Then the FOOTSTEPS continue down the hall and up the stairs."
"3015",3015,"               After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining "
"3016",3016,"               how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate "
"3017",3017,"               with no money down."
"3018",3018,"               PAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the "
"3019",3019,"               mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the "
"3020",3020,"               ceiling."
"3021",3021,"                                                               DISSOLVE TO:"
"3022",3022,"               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT."
"3023",3023,"               We hear a clap of THUNDER and once again the rain pours down."

"3025",3025,"               CLOSE UP: PAUL--eyes closed. There is another loud THUNDERCLAP "
"3026",3026,"               which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes."
"3027",3027,"               He turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard, "
"3028",3028,"               LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed."
"3029",3029,"               Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls "
"3030",3030,"               it out and starts out of the room."
"3031",3031,"               PAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes "
"3032",3032,"               him to collapse, unconscious."
"3033",3033,"                                                                    "

"3035",3035,"               It's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly, "
"3036",3036,"               we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud--"
"3037",3037,"               for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: "
"3038",3038,"               It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going, "
"3039",3039,"               \""Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me "

"3041",3041,"               discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his "
"3042",3042,"               arms, but that's it."
"3043",3043,"                                                                    "
"3044",3044,"               ANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together; "
"3045",3045,"               her eyes are bright. Too bright. Way too bright."
"3046",3046,"               She comes to the foot of his bed."

"3059",3059,"                         Paul, my little ceramic penguin in "
"3060",3060,"                         the study always faces due south."
"3061",3061,"                                     PAUL"
"3062",3062,"                         I don't know what you're talking "

"3064",3064,"               PAUL looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere. As "
"3065",3065,"               he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the "
"3066",3066,"               mattress edge."
"3067",3067,"                                                                    "
"3068",3068,"               ANNIE, as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt "
"3069",3069,"               pocket."
"3070",3070,"                                     ANNIE"
"3071",3071,"                         Is this what you're looking for? I "
"3072",3072,"                         know you've been out twice, Paul. At "
"3073",3073,"                         first, I couldn't figure out how you "
"3074",3074,"                         did it, but last night I found your "
"3075",3075,"                         key."
"3076",3076,"                              (She holds up the "
"3077",3077,"                              bobby pin)"
"3078",3078,"                         I know I left  my scrapbook out, and "
"3079",3079,"                         I can imagine what you might be "
"3080",3080,"                         thinking of me. But you see, Paul, "
"3081",3081,"                         it's all okay."
"3082",3082,"                                                                    "
"3083",3083,"               ANNIE, as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed."
"3084",3084,"               And now a THUMP comes from the foot of the bed. Something is "
"3085",3085,"               out of sight."
"3086",3086,"                                                                    "
"3087",3087,"               PAUL, staring at her; waiting."
"3088",3088,"                                     ANNIE"
"3089",3089,"                         Last night it came so clear. I realize "
"3090",3090,"                         you just need more time. Eventually, "
"3091",3091,"                         you'll come to accept the idea of "
"3092",3092,"                         being here. Paul, do you know about "
"3093",3093,"                         the early days at the Kimberly Diamond "
"3094",3094,"                         Mine? Do you know what they did to "
"3095",3095,"                         the native workers who stole diamonds? "
"3096",3096,"                         Don't worry, they didn't kill them. "
"3097",3097,"                         That would be like junking a Mercedes "
"3098",3098,"                         just because it had a broken spring--"
"3099",3099,"                         no, if they caught them they had to "
"3100",3100,"                         make sure they could go on working, "
"3101",3101,"                         but they also had to make sure they "
"3102",3102,"                         could never run away. The operation "
"3103",3103,"                         was called hobbling."
"3104",3104,"               And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up "
"3105",3105,"               holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood."
"3106",3106,"                                     PAUL"
"3107",3107,"                         Annie, whatever you're thinking about, "
"3108",3108,"                         don't do it."
"3109",3109,"                                                                    "
"3110",3110,"               ANNIE. She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just "
"3111",3111,"               above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet."
"3112",3112,"                                     ANNIE"
"3113",3113,"                         Now don't fuss, Paul."
"3114",3114,"                                     PAUL"
"3115",3115,"                         Why would I run away? I'm a writer, "
"3116",3116,"                         Annie--it's all I am--and I've never "
"3117",3117,"                         written this well--even you said "
"3118",3118,"                         that this is my best, didn't you?"

"3606",3606,"               Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, "
"3607",3607,"               smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar "

"3620",3620,"                         But don't worry, Paul. I've already "
"3621",3621,"                         prepared for what must be done. I "
"3622",3622,"                         put two bullets in my gun, one for "
"3623",3623,"                         you and one for me. Oh, darling, it "
"3624",3624,"                         will be so beautiful."
