23,23,  SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
24,24,Woodlands.  Beautiful.  Untamed.  Soaring old-growth elms
25,25,arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently
26,26,"curving, deep-water Santee River."
27,27,SUPERIMPOSITION:
28,28,"				  SOUTH CAROLINA"
29,29,"				    April, 1776"
30,30,"Upstream, the swamps.  Beautiful.  Hundreds of BIRDS SING."
31,31,"Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the"
32,32,"hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns"
33,33,covering the high ground.
34,34,"The water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads,"
35,35,each with a stark white flower rising from it.
36,36,SUPERIMPOSITION:
37,37,"		 THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A"
38,38,"			TRUE STORY"
39,39,
40,40,  POND BLUFF - DAY
41,41,A farm built between the banks of the river and the deep
42,42,"green of the swamps.  Good, fertile land, hacked out of"
43,43,the wilderness.
44,44,"The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops,"
45,45,"alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and"
46,46,"SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging"
47,47,scythes through the barley.
48,48,"The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and"
49,49,"well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge."
50,50,It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the
51,51,"front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her"
52,52,"brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches."
53,53,"GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods"
54,54,with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his
55,55,"shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a"
56,56,musket.
57,57,
58,58,  WORKSHOP - DAY
59,59,"A perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with"
60,60,every conceivable tool of the period.  A foot-powered
61,61,"lathe.  A drop-forge.  A lifting saw.  Racks of tools,"
62,62,"planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in"
63,63,their places.  All very well-worn.
64,64,"FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a"
65,65,"piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a"
66,66,"razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and"
67,67,"weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle the"
68,68,chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and
69,69,"self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his"
70,70,"farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth."
71,71,"A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on"
72,72,"which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The"
73,73,"chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of"
74,74,"perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue."
75,75,"Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face"
76,76,"wisp of a child, watches her father."
77,77,"Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully"
78,78,"fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into"
79,79,place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork.
80,80,"He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale,"
81,81,countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats.
82,82,Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan
83,83,"nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floor"
84,84,"and walks slowly around it, checking every angle."
85,85,"Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers"
86,86,"himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time."
87,87,Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh.
88,88,CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPL
89,89,"RS under Marion's weight, DUMPING"
90,90,HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood.
91,91,"				MARION"
92,92,"		Damnation!"
93,93,"He picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the"
94,94,room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look.
95,95,He calms himself.
96,96,"				MARION"
97,97,"		Sorry."
98,98,Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of
99,99,the chair in the fireplace.  As she climbs back up to her
100,100,"perch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a"
101,101,"fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over"
102,102,again.
103,103,END CREDITS.
104,104,
105,105,  WORKSHOP - DUSK
106,106,Marion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side.  Nathan
107,107,"and Samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in the"
108,108,field.
109,109,"				NATHAN"
110,110,"		Father, I saw a post rider at the"
111,111,"		house."
112,112,"				MARION"
113,113,"		Thank you.  Did you finish the upper"
114,114,"		field?"
115,115,"				SAMUEL"
116,116,"		We got it all cut and we bundled"
117,117,"		half of it."
118,118,"				MARION"
119,119,"		Those swimming breaks cut into the"
120,120,"		day, don't they?"
121,121,Marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his
122,122,"contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off"
123,123,the blame.  Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn.
124,124,"				GABRIEL"
125,125,"		Father, a post rider came from"
126,126,"		Charleston.  You have a letter"
127,127,"		inside."
128,128,"				MARION"
129,129,"		Thank you.  How's the spotted one's"
130,130,"		milk?"
131,131,"				THOMAS"
132,132,"		Better.  She's near ready to calve."
133,133,Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and
134,134,Thomas to the house.  She does so and Marion walks on
135,135,alone toward:
136,136,
137,137,  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - SUNSET
138,138,The loveliest spot on the farm.  A beautiful view of the
139,139,"house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond.  A"
140,140,gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree.  It
141,141,reads:
142,142,"		ELIZABETH PUTNAM MARION   1738-1773"
143,143,"Above her name is a carving of the night sky, at the"
144,144,"center of which is the NORTH STAR, steady and guiding."
145,145,Marion approaches.  He gives himself a moment to look at
146,146,"the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the"
147,147,gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact
148,148,than sorrowful.
149,149,"				MARION"
150,150,"		... and they bundled half... almost"
151,151,"		no trace of the boys you knew..."
152,152,A soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground.
153,153,Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply.
154,154,"				MARION"
155,155,"		... no, she still hasn't spoken..."
156,156,"		Margaret was her age when you... I"
157,157,"		remember the time at the river when"
158,158,"		we couldn't find Catherine... you"
159,159,"		couldn't stop crying... and she was"
160,160,"		asleep in the wagon the entire"
161,161,"		time..."
162,162,"Marion pauses, remembering.  The CRASH OF A PLATE"
163,163,"BREAKING, followed by the SOUND OF AN ARGUMENT rises from"
164,164,the house below.  Marion shakes his head with an
165,165,exasperated sigh.
166,166,"				MARION"
167,167,"		Your children."
168,168,"He heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing from"
169,169,the lights of candles and oil lamps.
170,170,
171,171,  MARION'S HOUSE - EVENING
172,172,Pre-dinner chaos.  Everyone talking at once.  Marion's
173,173,"seven children and his two family servants, ABIGAIL and"
174,174,"AARON, a middle-aged black couple, prepare dinner.  Susan"
175,175,silently watches from the stairs.  Marion walks in.
176,176,"				MARION"
177,177,"		I smell turnips..."
178,178,"				WILLIAM"
179,179,"		Father, Samuel broke the blue"
180,180,"		plate..."
181,181,"				SAMUEL"
182,182,"		I did not..."
183,183,"				MARGARET"
184,184,"		Dinner..."
185,185,Marion hands the apples to Abigail and steps over to open
186,186,his mail and dispatches.
187,187,"				GABRIEL"
188,188,"		News of Boston, father?"
189,189,"				NATHAN"
190,190,"		I hate turnips..."
191,191,"				SAMUEL"
192,192,"		William knocked it right out of my"
193,193,"		hands..."
194,194,"				GABRIEL"
195,195,"		Father...?"
196,196,"				MARION"
197,197,"		Samuel, William, both of you clean"
198,198,"		it up..."
199,199,Marion hands a packet of pamphlets to Gabriel and opens a
200,200,letter.
201,201,"				MARION"
202,202,"		The Assembly has been reconvened,"
203,203,"		I've been called to..."
204,204,Marion's children go wild.
205,205,"				MARGARET"
206,206,"		Charleston!"
207,207,"				NATHAN"
208,208,"		We're going to Charleston!"
209,209,"				SAMUEL"
210,210,"		When, father, when?"
211,211,"				MARION"
212,212,"		We'll leave tomorrow..."
213,213,The children ERUPT 
214,214, CHEERS and THUNDER into the dining
215,215,room.
216,216,"				THE CHILDREN"
217,217,"		Charleston!  We're going to"
218,218,"		Charleston!"
219,219,Marion and Gabriel exchange a stone-faced look.  Then
220,220,Marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply.
221,221,"				MARION"
222,222,"		I love turnips..."
223,223,Marion follows his children into the dining room.
224,224,
225,225,  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT
226,226,Quiet.  The only sounds are the soft calls of a few
227,227,NIGHTBIRDS and the DRONE OF CICADAS.  A faint light moves
228,228,"through the downstairs, passing windows in the otherwise"
229,229,dark house.
230,230,
231,231,  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT
232,232,"Marion, holding a candle, does a father's bedtime check."
233,233,The CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he makes his rounds into:
234,234,THE KITCHEN.  Everything is clean and put away in its
235,235,proper place.
236,236,THE MAIN HALLWAY.  Marion checks that the doors are closed
237,237,and bolted.  He heads up the stairs.
238,238,
239,239,  BOYS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
240,240,"Marion enters, finding William asleep on the floor and"
241,241,"Nathan and Samuel in bed.  He lifts William into bed,"
242,242,"takes a slingshot from Nathan's hand, tucks in Samuel and"
243,243,walks out.
244,244,
245,245,  GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
246,246,"Marion steps to the doorway, finding Margaret and Susan at"
247,247,"the window, looking up at the night sky."
248,248,"				MARGARET"
249,249,"		... now count five finger lengths up"
250,250,"		from the front two stars of the Big"
251,251,"		Dipper, and that's the North Star,"
252,252,"		that's her."
253,253,Susan gazes up at the North Star.  The girls notice Marion
254,254,and climb into bed.  He puts a chair against Susan's bed
255,255,"and kisses her.  He pulls a blanket up around Margaret,"
256,256,who whispers:
257,257,"				MARGARET"
258,258,"		It helps her to know Mother's there."
259,259,"Marion nods with a thin smile, kisses Margaret and walks"
260,260,out.
261,261,
262,262,  MARION'S STUDY - NIGHT
263,263,Squadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle as
264,264,"Thomas, lying on the floor, deploys his men.  Gabriel"
265,265,reads the new pamphlets and broadsides.  Marion walks in
266,266,and pours a drink.  Gabriel hands several of the pamphlets
267,267,to his father.
268,268,"				GABRIEL"
269,269,"		The New York and Rhode Island"
270,270,"		assemblies have been dissolved..."
271,271,"				MARION"
272,272,"		The middle colonies?"
273,273,"				GABRIEL"
274,274,"		Rioting both sides of the bay, in"
275,275,"		Chestertown they burned the Customs"
276,276,"		House and tar-and-feathered the"
277,277,"		Customs Agent.  He died of burns."
278,278,"		In Wilmington they killed a Royal"
279,279,"		Magistrate and two Redcoats."
280,280,"				MARION"

283,283,"				GABRIEL"
284,284,"		Poor Richard says they'll make a"
285,285,"		Declaration of Independence by July."
286,286,"Marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting"
287,287,a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box.  He
288,288,begins reading.
289,289,"				GABRIEL"
290,290,"		Scott Higgins joined the militia."
291,291,Marion hears but doesn't respond.  Thomas looks up from
292,292,his lead soldiers.
293,293,"				GABRIEL"
294,294,"		He's seventeen.  A year younger than"
295,295,"		I."
296,296,Gabriel and Thomas wait for a reaction.  There is none.
297,297,Gabriel goes back to reading and Thomas resumes playing
298,298,with his toy soldiers.  Marion's eyes drift from the page
299,299,to Gabriel.
300,300,
301,301,  SWAMP ROAD - DAY
302,302,"The Marion family, in two tightly-packed carriages, drives"
303,303,"on a beautiful road, cut through the swamps.  The canopy"
304,304,of swamp maples and weeping willows forms a tunnel of
305,305,"green, mottled by sunlight."
306,306,
307,307,  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY

317,317,
318,318,  CHARLESTON - DAY
319,319,"A big, bustling city.  Marion and Gabriel negotiate the"
320,320,"carriages through the busy streets.  The children watch,"
321,321,"wide-eyed, seeing taverns, a public gallows, drunkards,"
322,322,"street entertainers, well-dressed ladies attended by their"
323,323,"maids, food venders, a man with a trained bear."
324,324,
325,325,  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CHARLESTON - DAY
326,326,Grand.  Four stories.  Marion and his children pull up.
327,327,"CHARLOTTE MOTTE hurries out.  She's in her mid-thirties,"
328,328,"beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as"
329,329,best she can.
330,330,"The children leap from the carriages and swarm around her,"
331,331,"embracing her, smothering her with kisses."
332,332,"				THE CHILDREN"
333,333,"		Aunt Charlotte!  Aunt Charlotte!"

339,339,"		feeding them?"
340,340,"				MARION"
341,341,"		They're from good stock on their"
342,342,"		mother's side."
343,343,"				CHARLOTTE"
344,344,"		Thank you."
345,345,Charlotte hustles the children toward the door.
346,346,"				CHARLOTTE"
347,347,"		Come, come, inside, wait until you"
348,348,"		see what I have..."
349,349,"				THE CHILDREN"
350,350,"			   (simultaneous)"
351,351,"		Presents!  For me?  What do you"
352,352,"		have?"
353,353,"				CHARLOTTE"
354,354,"		Inside, inside..."
355,355,Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her

357,357,
358,358,  PARLOR - CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - DAY
359,359,Marion watches as Charlotte finishes handing out presents.

362,362,"a new dress up to herself.  Samuel, Nathan and Thomas tear"
363,363,into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers.  Gabriel
364,364,looks through a new book.
365,365,"Charlotte sees Marion watching her, rises and joins him at"
366,366,the doorway.
367,367,"				MARION"
368,368,"		You look well, Charlotte."
369,369,"				CHARLOTTE"
370,370,"		As do you."
371,371,"Suddenly Thomas and Samuel race through the doorway,"
372,372,"forcing Marion and Charlotte together, their bodies close."
373,373,They step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles.
374,374,The moment is broken by the SOUND OF CHILDREN.  Marion and
375,375,Charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them.
376,376,
377,377,  CHARLESTON SQUARE - NIGHT
378,378,Down the block from the Motte house.  A yelling crowd of
379,379,Sons of Liberty is massed around a Liberty Tree from which
380,380,hang dozens of glowing lanterns.  Most of the men in the
381,381,"crowd are drunk.  Vendors sell rum, ale, food and banners"
382,382,"emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend, \""Don't"
383,383,"Tread On Me.\""  Scores of on-lookers, including respectable"
384,384,"people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards,"
385,385,watch the proceedings.
386,386,Several Sons of Liberty string up effigies of King George
387,387,III and Governor Wilmington.  They light the effigies on
388,388,"fire.  As they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers."
389,389,
390,390,  CHARLOTTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT
391,391,"Marion's children, except Gabriel, stand on the balcony"
392,392,watching the mob.  Marion steps out onto the balcony.
393,393,"				MARION"
394,394,"		Inside, all of you..."
395,395,The children turn to Marion with stricken expressions.
396,396,Marion relents.
397,397,"				MARION"
398,398,"		Very well."
399,399,The children turn back to the mob.  Marion joins them.
400,400,"				THOMAS"
401,401,"		Look!  There's Gabriel!"
402,402,They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd.  He
403,403,"sees them and waves, then enters the house."
404,404,A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and
405,405,sees:
406,406,"IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down"
407,407,"one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then"
408,408,start hacking at it's groin with a sword.
409,409,"Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at"
410,410,the children.
411,411,"				CHARLOTTE"
412,412,"		Children, inside!  All of you!"
413,413,"		Right now."
414,414,"The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's"
415,415,resolute expression makes them think better of it.  They
416,416,file into the house.  Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion
417,417,and shoos the children inside.  Gabriel steps out and
418,418,joins them.
419,419,"				MARION"
420,420,"		What news?"
421,421,"				GABRIEL"
422,422,"		The British army is barricaded in"
423,423,"		Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from"
424,424,"		Virginia, recruiting for a"
425,425,"		Continental Army."
426,426,"				MARION"
427,427,"		Is that why the Assembly was"
428,428,"		convened?"
429,429,"				GABRIEL"
430,430,"		Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and"
431,431,"		money."
432,432,"				MARION"
433,433,"		And the Governor?"
434,434,"				GABRIEL"
435,435,"		He vowed that if the Assembly votes"
436,436,"		a single shilling to Lee, he'll"
437,437,"		dissolve the body."
438,438,"				MARION"
439,439,"		Which would force our delegates in"
440,440,"		Philadelphia to vote for"
441,441,"		independence."
442,442,"				CHARLOTTE"
443,443,"		And send us to war alongside"
444,444,"		Massachusetts."
445,445,"				MARION"
446,446,"		Our governor is a bigger fool than I"
447,447,"		thought."
448,448,"				GABRIEL"
449,449,"		Lee is counting on your vote and"
450,450,"		expects you to be the first to"
451,451,"		enlist."
452,452,Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks
453,453,of Lee's expectations.  Marion turns back to watch the
454,454,mob.
455,455,
456,456,  ASSEMBLY HALL - CHARLESTON - DAY
457,457,The capital building of South Carolina.  A large crowd of
458,458,lower-class men and women is massed in front of the
459,459,Assembly Hall.  As well-dressed Assemblymen walk into the
460,460,"building, the CROWD YELLS words of encouragement to some"
461,461,and berates others.
462,462,In the square in front of the Assembly Hall a squadron of
463,463,blue-uniformed AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS drills.  A
464,464,recruiting table is being set up by a Continental Captain
465,465,and several military clerks.
466,466,Marion and Gabriel walk across the square toward the
467,467,"Assembly Hall.  As they push their way through the crowd,"
468,468,Gabriel eyes the Continentals.
469,469,
470,470,  ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY
471,471,"Two dozen ANGRY, YELLING, MEN OF PROPERTY.  Among them are"
472,472,"ROBINSON, HAMILL and JOHNSON, who are Patriots.  Opposed"
473,473,"to them are SIMMS, WITHINGTON and BALDRIDGE who are"
474,474,Loyalists (loyal the the King).  As Marion makes his way
475,475,"to his seat, the SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY POUNDS HIS GAVEL."
476,476,"				SPEAKER"
477,477,"		ORDER!  ORDER!"
478,478,"Slowly, the room quiets down."
479,479,"				SPEAKER"
480,480,"		Our first order of business..."
481,481,"				SIMMS"
482,482,"		And out last if we vote a levy..."
483,483,The ROOM ERUPTS.
484,484,"				SPEAKER"
485,485,"		ORDER!  ORDER!  Mr. Simms, you do"
486,486,"		not have the floor."
487,487,The ROOM SETTLES DOWN.
488,488,"				SPEAKER"
489,489,"		Our first order of business is an"
490,490,"		address by Colonel Harry Lee of the"
491,491,"		Continental Army."
492,492,An imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of
493,493,"the assembly.  He's COLONEL HARRY LEE, about Marion's age"
494,494,"and cut from the same cloth -- strong, weathered, with a"
495,495,powerful bearing.  The room quiets down.
496,496,"Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod, which Marion"
497,497,"returns, stone-faced.  Then Lee speaks, simply and"
498,498,clearly.
499,499,"				LEE"
500,500,"		You all know why I am here.  I am"
501,501,"		not an orator and I will not try to"
502,502,"		convince you of the worthiness of"
503,503,"		our cause.  I am a soldier and we"
504,504,"		are at war and with the declaration"
505,505,"		of independence we all expect from"
506,506,"		Philadelphia, it will soon be a"
507,507,"		formal state of war.  In preparation"
508,508,"		for that, eight of the thirteen"
509,509,"		colonies have levied money in"
510,510,"		support of a Continental Army.  I"
511,511,"		ask South Carolina to be the ninth."
512,512,"				SIMMS"
513,513,"		Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at"
514,514,"		war, along with New Hampshire and"
515,515,"		Rhode Island and Virginia, but South"
516,516,"		Carolina is not at war."
517,517,"				LEE"
518,518,"		Massachusetts and New Hampshire are"
519,519,"		not as far from South Carolina as"
520,520,"		you might think and the war they're"
521,521,"		fighting is not for independence of"
522,522,"		one or two colonies.  It's for the"
523,523,"		independence of a nation."
524,524,"				WITHINGTON"
525,525,"		And what nation is that?"
526,526,"Robinson, one of the Patriots, stands up."
527,527,"				ROBINSON"
528,528,"		An American nation.  Colonel Lee,"
529,529,"		with your permission?"
530,530,"				LEE"
531,531,"		Please."
532,532,"				ROBINSON"
533,533,"		Those of us who call ourselves"
534,534,"		Patriots are not seeking to give"
535,535,"		birth to an American nation, but to"
536,536,"		protect one that already exists.  It"
537,537,"		was born a hundred-and-seventy years"
538,538,"		ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has"
539,539,"		grown stronger and more mature with"
540,540,"		every generation reared and with"
541,541,"		every crop sown and harvested.  We"
542,542,"		are a nation and our rights as"
543,543,"		citizens of that nation are"
544,544,"		threatened by a tyrant three"
545,545,"		thousand miles away."
546,546,"				LEE"
547,547,"		Thank you.  Were I an orator, those"
548,548,"		are the exact words I would have"
549,549,"		spoken."
550,550,Laughter.  Marion rises.
551,551,"				MARION"
552,552,"		Mister Robinson, tell me, why should"
553,553,"		I trade one tyrant, three thousand"
554,554,"		miles away, for three thousand"
555,555,"		tyrants, one mile away?"
556,556,Laughter from the Loyalists.  Surprise from Lee and the
557,557,"Patriots.  In the gallery, Gabriel winces."
558,558,"				ROBINSON"
559,559,"		Sir?"
560,560,"				MARION"
561,561,"		An elected legislature can trample a"
562,562,"		man's rights just as easily as a"
563,563,"		King can."
564,564,"				LEE"
565,565,"		Captain Marion, I understood you to"
566,566,"		be a Patriot."
567,567,"				MARION"
568,568,"		It's Mister Marion."
569,569,"				LEE"
570,570,"		I understood him to be a Patriot as"
571,571,"		well."
572,572,More laughter.
573,573,"				MARION"
574,574,"		If you mean by a Patriot, am I angry"
575,575,"		at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp"
576,576,"		Act?  Then I'm a Patriot.  And what"
577,577,"		of the Navigation Act?  Should I be"
578,578,"		permitted to sell my tobacco to the"
579,579,"		French traders on Martinique?  Yes,"
580,580,"		and it's an intrusion into my"
581,581,"		affairs that I can't... legally."
582,582,Laughter.
583,583,"				MARION"
584,584,"		And what of the greedy, self-serving"
585,585,"		bastards who sit as Magistrates on"
586,586,"		the Admiralty Court and have fined"
587,587,"		nearly every man in this room."
588,588,"		Should they be boxed about the ears"
589,589,"		and thrown onto the first ship back"
590,590,"		to England?  I'll do it myself."
591,591,"			   (beat)"
592,592,"		And do I believe that the American"
593,593,"		colonies should stand as a separate,"
594,594,"		independent nation, free from the"
595,595,"		reins of King and Parliament?  I do,"
596,596,"		and if that makes a Patriot, then"
597,597,"		I'm a Patriot."
598,598,Marion grows more serious.
599,599,"				MARION"
600,600,"		But if you're asking whether I'm"
601,601,"		willing to go to war with England,"
602,602,"		the answer is, no.  I've been to war"
603,603,"		and I have no desire to do so again."
604,604,"The room is quiet, the Assemblymen having been thrown off-"
605,605,balance.  Gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his
606,606,father's speech.
607,607,"				ROBINSON"
608,608,"		This from the same Captain Francis"
609,609,"		Marion whose anger was so famous"
610,610,"		during the Wilderness Campaign."
611,611,"Marion glares at Robinson, then smiles."
612,612,"				MARION"
613,613,"		I was intemperate in my youth.  My"
614,614,"		departed wife, God bless her soul,"
615,615,"		dampened that intemperance with the"
616,616,"		mantle of responsibility."
617,617,Robinson looks derisively at Marion.
618,618,"				ROBINSON"
619,619,"		Temperance can be a convenient"
620,620,"		disguise for fear."
621,621,"Marion bristles but before he can answer, Lee steps in."
622,622,"				LEE"
623,623,"		Mister Robinson, I fought with"
624,624,"		Captain Marion in the French and"
625,625,"		Indian War, including the Wilderness"
626,626,"		Campaign.  We served as scouts under"
627,627,"		Washington and I have no doubts"
628,628,"		about Captain Marion's courage or"
629,629,"		competence on a battlefield."
630,630,"		There's not a man in this room, or"
631,631,"		anywhere, for that matter, to whom I"
632,632,"		would more willingly trust my life."
633,633,"				ROBINSON"
634,634,"		I stand corrected."
635,635,"				LEE"
636,636,"		Nonetheless, I would like to know,"
637,637,"		Mister Marion, how... how... how..."
638,638,Lee's oratorical skills peter out.
639,639,"				LEE"
640,640,"		Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name"
641,641,"		do you expect to gain independence"
642,642,"		without going to war?"
643,643,"				MARION"
644,644,"		Harry, Harry, Harry..."
645,645,Marion and Lee drop all formality and become nothing more
646,646,"than two old friends, pissed off."
647,647,"				LEE"
648,648,"		My hairy arse!  You live in a cave"
649,649,"		if you think we'll get independence"
650,650,"		without war..."
651,651,The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL.
652,652,"				SPEAKER"
653,653,"		Gentlemen!  Please!  This is not a"
654,654,"		tavern!"
655,655,"				MARION"
656,656,"		Wasn't it a Union Jack we fought"
657,657,"		under?"
658,658,"				LEE"
659,659,"		A long time ago..."
660,660,"				MARION"
661,661,"		Thirteen years..."
662,662,"				LEE"
663,663,"		That's a damn long time..."
664,664,The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again.
665,665,"				SPEAKER"
666,666,"		Gentlemen!  Please!"
667,667,Marion and Lee ignore the speaker.
668,668,"				MARION"
669,669,"		You were an Englishman then..."
670,670,"				LEE"
671,671,"		I was an American, I just didn't"
672,672,"		know it yet..."
673,673,The astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watch
674,674,"the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous"
675,675,anticipation of each rejoinder.
676,676,"				MARION"
677,677,"		We don't have to go to war to gain"
678,678,"		independence..."
679,679,"				LEE"
680,680,"		Balderdash!"
681,681,"				MARION"
682,682,"		There are a thousand avenues, other"
683,683,"		than war, at our disposal..."
684,684,"				LEE"
685,685,"		Name five hundred."
686,686,"				MARION"
687,687,"		Royal petition, delegates to court,"
688,688,"		judicial redress, economic boycott,"
689,689,"		bribery..."
690,690,"				LEE"
691,691,"		That's five, keep going..."
692,692,"				MARION"
693,693,"		... time, royal succession,"
694,694,"		regicide, bribery..."
695,695,"				LEE"
696,696,"		You said bribery twice..."
697,697,Marion speaks slowly and firmly.
698,698,"				MARION"
699,699,"		We do not have to go to war to gain"
700,700,"		independence."
701,701,"Lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more"
702,702,"seriously, quietly, grimly."
703,703,"				LEE"
704,704,"		Francis, I was at Bunker Hill.  It"
705,705,"		was as bad as anything you and I saw"
706,706,"		on the frontier.  Worse than the"
707,707,"		slaughter at the Ashuelot River."
708,708,"		The British advanced three times and"
709,709,"		we killed over seven hundred of them"
710,710,"		at point blank range.  And still,"
711,711,"		they advanced and they took the"
712,712,"		ground.  That is the measure of"
713,713,"		their resolve.  If your principles"
714,714,"		dictate independence, then war is"
715,715,"		the only way.  It has come to that."
716,716,"Marion is silent for a long moment.  He softens, finds"
717,717,himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever
718,718,wanted to.
719,719,"				MARION"
720,720,"		I have seven children.  My wife is"
721,721,"		dead.  Who's to care for them if I"
722,722,"		go to war?"
723,723,Lee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show of
724,724,"weakness.  At first Lee has no answer, then:"
725,725,"				LEE"
726,726,"		Wars are not fought only by"
727,727,"		childless men.  A man must weigh his"
728,728,"		personal responsibilities against"
729,729,"		his principles."
730,730,"				MARION"
731,731,"		That's what I'm doing.  I will not"
732,732,"		fight and because I won't, I will"
733,733,"		not cast a vote that will send"
734,734,"		others to fight in my stead."
735,735,"				LEE"
736,736,"		And your principles?"
737,737,"				MARION"
738,738,"		I'm a parent, I don't have the"
739,739,"		luxury of principles."
740,740,"The other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stare"
741,741,"at him, appalled.  Marion, feeling weak, sits down.  Lee"
742,742,looks at his friend with more sympathy than
743,743,disappointment.  Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses
744,744,the chair.
745,745,"				ROBINSON"
746,746,"		Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on"
747,747,"		a levy to the Continental Army."
748,748,"				HAMILL"
749,749,"		Second."
750,750,"				SPEAKER"
751,751,"		So moved."
752,752,The vote is taken on a roll call.  Gabriel watches from
753,753,the gallery.
754,754,"				SPEAKER"
755,755,"		Mr. Robinson."
756,756,"				ROBINSON"
757,757,"		Yea."
758,758,"				SPEAKER"
759,759,"		Mr. Hamill."
760,760,"				HAMILL"
761,761,"		Yea."
762,762,"				SPEAKER"
763,763,"		Mr. Johnson."
764,764,"				JOHNSON"
765,765,"		Yea."
766,766,"				SPEAKER"
767,767,"		Mr. Simms."
768,768,"				SIMMS"
769,769,"		Nay."
770,770,"				SPEAKER"
771,771,"		Mr. Marion."
772,772,No response.
773,773,"				SPEAKER"
774,774,"		Mr. Marion."
775,775,"				MARION"
776,776,"		Nay."
777,777,In the gallery Gabriel turns and walks out.  The roll call
778,778,"continues.  Marion sits, eyes straight ahead."
779,779,
780,780,  ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY
781,781,The crowd waits.  The doors open and a PAGE BOY dashes out
782,782,and runs to the Continental Captain at the recruiting
783,783,table.
784,784,"				PAGE BOY"
785,785,"		Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy"
786,786,"		passed!"
787,787,The Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron.
788,788,They raise their muskets and FIRE A VOLLEY into the air.
789,789,"Other soldiers, STRIKE UP A MARTIAL AIR ON FIFES AND"
790,790,"DRUMS.  Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table,"
791,791,YELLING and jostling for position.
792,792,The delegates walk out.  Both Patriots and Loyalists give
793,793,Marion a wide berth.
794,794,"Marion sees Gabriel, standing near the crowd at the"
795,795,recruiting table.  Marion walks up to him.
796,796,"				GABRIEL"
797,797,"		Father, I've lost respect for you."
798,798,"		I thought you were a man of"
799,799,"		principle."
800,800,"				MARION"
801,801,"		When you have children, I hope"
802,802,"		you'll understand."
803,803,"				GABRIEL"
804,804,"		When I have children, I hope I don't"
805,805,"		hide behind them."
806,806,Marion looks closely at Gabriel.
807,807,"				MARION"
808,808,"		Do you intend to enlist without my"
809,809,"		permission?"
810,810,"				GABRIEL"
811,811,"		Yes."
812,812,"They lock eyes for a moment, then Gabriel turns from his"
813,813,"father and walks away, joining the crush around the"
814,814,recruiting table.
815,815,Marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos.  The FIFES
816,816,AND DRUMS continue to play.  Marion doesn't hear them.
817,817,Harry Lee walks out of the Assembly hall with a triumphant
818,818,group of Patriots who look at Marion coldly.
819,819,"Lee excuses himself, and steps over next to Marion.  Lee"
820,820,sees that Marion is watching Gabriel at the enlistment
821,821,table.
822,822,"				LEE"
823,823,"		One of yours?"
824,824,"				MARION"
825,825,"		Gabriel."
826,826,"				LEE"
827,827,"		I recognize him now.  Is he as"
828,828,"		imprudent as his father was at his"
829,829,"		age?"
830,830,"				MARION"
831,831,"		No, thank the Lord.  He's more like"
832,832,"		his mother."
833,833,"				LEE"
834,834,"		I'll see to it that he serves under"
835,835,"		me."
836,836,"				MARION"
837,837,"		Thank you."
838,838,They shake hands.  Then Lee walks over to the soldiers.
839,839,"Marion takes a last look at Gabriel, then heads off"
840,840,"through the crowded square, moving against the tide of men"
841,841,headed toward the recruiting table.
842,842,
843,843,  POND BLUFF - DAY
844,844,Springtime.  The apple tree at the top of the hill is
845,845,covered with blossoms.

849,849,  FIELD - POND BLUFF - DAY
850,850,Marion plows a field.  Nathan leads the plowhorse.  Samuel
851,851,"follows, breaking up the clods of dirt.  Hard work.  They"
852,852,stop to catch their breath.  A SOFT WIND blows.
853,853,Marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice.
854,854,He hears nothing.  He snaps the reins and continues
855,855,plowing.
856,856,
857,857,  MARION'S ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON
858,858,Dark.  Thomas steps up into the attic.  He finds a trunk
859,859,"and opens it.  Lifting out some blankets, he uncovers a"
860,860,"trove of Marion's old military gear -- a worn battle coat,"
861,861,"a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into its"
862,862,scabbard.
863,863,"Thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrow"
864,864,"shoulders.  He stands in front of a dusty mirror,"
865,865,"appraising himself, then stops as he hears FOOTSTEPS"
866,866,coming up the stairs.
867,867,"It's Marion, tired and dirty from his plowing.  Thomas"
868,868,"grimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shake"
869,869,his head gently.
870,870,"				MARION"
871,871,"		Not yet, Thomas."
872,872,"				THOMAS"
873,873,"		When?"
874,874,"Marion looks closely at his son, giving him the courtesy"
875,875,of really thinking about the answer.
876,876,"				MARION"
877,877,"		Seventeen."
878,878,"				THOMAS"
879,879,"		But it's already been two years and"
880,880,"		that's two more years.  The war"
881,881,"		could be over by then."
882,882,"				MARION"
883,883,"		God willing."
884,884,"Thomas considers it, then nods."
885,885,"				THOMAS"
886,886,"		Alright.  Seventeen."
887,887,"Marion offers his hand.  They shake firmly, like adults."
888,888,Marion takes the coat off Thomas and puts it back in the
889,889,trunk.  They walk down the stairs together.
890,890,
891,891,  POND BLUFF - DAWN
892,892,All is quiet.  A dawn mist hovers close over the ground.
893,893,Some sparrows feed at the base of the apple tree near the
894,894,gravesite.  DISTANT THUNDER.  Low and rolling.  The birds
895,895,"stop feeding, uneasy, then fly away."
896,896,
897,897,  MARION'S BEDROOM - DAWN
898,898,At another roll of the DISTANT THUNDER Marion awakes.  He
899,899,gets out of bed and pulls on his clothes.
900,900,
901,901,  FRONT PORCH - MARION'S HOUSE - DAWN
902,902,Marion steps out to his front porch and listens.  He knows
903,903,"the sound, the DISTANT STACCATO BOOMS OF CANNON and the"
904,904,PATTERING WAVE OF THOUSANDS OF MUSKETS FIRING.
905,905,"One by one the children join him.  Thomas, Nathan and"
906,906,Samuel listen analytically.  Margaret and Susan press
907,907,close against their father.  William looks curiously at
908,908,the cloudless sky.
909,909,"				WILLIAM"
910,910,"		Is it going to rain?"
911,911,"				THOMAS"
912,912,"		That's not thunder."
913,913,"The SOUND BECOMES DEEPER, MORE OMINOUS.  They all notice"
914,914,the change.
915,915,"				NATHAN"
916,916,"		Father?"
917,917,"				MARION"
918,918,"		Six-pounders.  Lots of them."
919,919,"				MARGARET"
920,920,"		How far away?"
921,921,"				MARION"
922,922,"		Four, five miles."
923,923,"				SAMUEL"
924,924,"		Waxhaus?"
925,925,"				MARION"
926,926,"		Just east of it."
927,927,"				MARGARET"
928,928,"		Are we safe here?"
929,929,Marion puts on a smile.
930,930,"				MARION"
931,931,"		Don't worry."
932,932,"				MARGARET"
933,933,"		We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's"
934,934,"		farm.  She's to the west."
935,935,"				MARION"
936,936,"		No, there'll be skirmishers on the"
937,937,"		roads.  We're safer here."
938,938,Thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets.  He
939,939,gives one to Nathan and offers the other to his father.
940,940,"				MARION"
941,941,"		Put those away."
942,942,"				THOMAS"
943,943,"		But father, they might come this"
944,944,"		way."
945,945,"				MARION"
946,946,"		Put them away."
947,947,"Reluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house."
948,948,"				MARION"
949,949,"		Enough.  I'll be in the workshop."
950,950,"		Samuel, the cows.  Thomas, attend to"
951,951,"		your studies here on the porch."
952,952,"		Nathan, on the back porch.  If you"
953,953,"		see anyone, come get me.  Margaret,"
954,954,"		please keep William close to you."
955,955,"		No one is to go past the yard wall."
956,956,"They all nod.  Marion walks off toward the workshop,"
957,957,followed by Susan.  The others hesitate.
958,958,"				MARION"
959,959,"		Children."
960,960,They head off to do as they were told.
961,961,
962,962,  WORKSHOP - DAY
963,963,Marion works the lathe.  Susan watches from her perch on
964,964,the woodpile.
965,965,
966,966,  BARN - DAY
967,967,The SOUND OF A CRASH from inside the barn.  An angry cow
968,968,"runs out of the barn, dragging a tenacious Samuel who is"
969,969,holding onto the cow's neck.
970,970,Samuel's grip fails and he lands in the dirt.  The cow
971,971,"runs about thirty yards down the hill, stopping on the"
972,972,bank of the river.  Samuel grabs a rope and heads down the
973,973,hill to get the cow.
974,974,ON THE RIVERBANK
975,975,"As Samuel approaches the cow, he see it skittishly"
976,976,approaching then retreating from the water.  Then he sees
977,977,"the cause -- the water in the river has a pale, pink hue."
978,978,"Samuel stares at it, trying to figure out what it is."
979,979,"Behind him, Margaret sees her brother beyond the yard"
980,980,wall.
981,981,"				MARGARET"
982,982,"		Samuel..."
983,983,"He doesn't respond.  Margaret, trailed by William, walks"
984,984,down toward Samuel.
985,985,"				MARGARET"
986,986,"		Samuel, get up to the house.  You"
987,987,"		heard father..."
988,988,"Then she sees it, too.  The pale pink is turning redder"
989,989,"and redder.  And then the BODIES.  First one, then more,"
990,990,many more.  Torn apart.  Missing limbs.  Those with wide-
991,991,"open wounds, are already drained of blood.  Others are"
992,992,"still seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler red"
993,993,of the surrounding water.
994,994,"Samuel, Margaret and William stand frozen, appalled and"
995,995,fascinated.
996,996,MARION steps out of the workshop and sees the children at
997,997,the river.  He can't see what they're looking at.
998,998,"Irritated, he walks toward them.  Then, as he nears the"
999,999,"river, he sees the color of the water and the bodies that"
1000,1000,"have hypnotized his children.  He quickens his stride,"
1001,1001,"speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them."
1002,1002,"				MARION"
1003,1003,"		Up to the house, now.  All of you,"
1004,1004,"		come on.  Now."
1005,1005,
1006,1006,  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT
1007,1007,"Quiet.  Dark.  Marion stands on the front porch, looking"
1008,1008,"out into the night, listening, hearing nothing.  He"
1009,1009,"glances up at the star-filled sky, tracking his eyes from"
1010,1010,the Big Dipper to the NORTH STAR.
1011,1011,"BEHIND THE HOUSE, A FIGURE IN THE DARKNESS, carrying a"
1012,1012,"musket, moves from shadow to shadow."
1013,1013,
1014,1014,  KITCHEN - NIGHT
1015,1015,"Margaret and Samuel and William talk, their voices low."
1016,1016,"				SAMUEL"
1017,1017,"		They're going to come."
1018,1018,"				MARGARET"
1019,1019,"		Quiet."
1020,1020,"				SAMUEL"
1021,1021,"		We're going to have to fight them"
1022,1022,"		off."
1023,1023,"				WILLIAM"
1024,1024,"		Father will do that."
1025,1025,"				SAMUEL"
1026,1026,"		They'll probably kill us men and do"
1027,1027,"		Lord knows what to you women."
1028,1028,"				MARGARET"
1029,1029,"		Samuel!"
1030,1030,A SOUND.  They all stop.  Something moved behind the
1031,1031,kitchen.  Margaret silently eases the others out of the
1032,1032,"room, through the darkened hall toward their father."
1033,1033,"SUDDENLY IN FRONT OF THEM, A BLOODY FIGURE"
1034,1034,Big.  Hulking.  In uniform.  Margaret SCREAMS.  William
1035,1035,and Samuel CRY OUT.  The figure moves toward them...
1036,1036,"Marion, on the porch, hears the scream, races into the"
1037,1037,"house.  He sees the figure, moves toward it..."
1038,1038,THE FIGURE MOVES 
1039,1039, THE LIGHT... Marion sees the
1040,1040,bloodied face...
1041,1041,"				MARION"
1042,1042,"		Gabriel!"
1043,1043,"Gabriel is wounded, battered and dirty.  He carries a"
1044,1044,musket and a dispatch case.  He sways.  Marion catches him
1045,1045,and eases him to a seat.
1046,1046,"				MARGARET"
1047,1047,"		You're hurt."
1048,1048,"				THOMAS"
1049,1049,"		The battle, were you there?"
1050,1050,"				MARION"
1051,1051,"		Margaret, get bandages and water."
1052,1052,"		Thomas, the porch, eyes open."
1053,1053,Marion checks Gabriel's wounds which are nasty but not
1054,1054,life-threatening.
1055,1055,"				GABRIEL"
1056,1056,"		Have you seen any Redcoats?"
1057,1057,"				MARION"
1058,1058,"		Not yet.  What happened?"
1059,1059,Margaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertly
1060,1060,cleans Gabriel's wounds and applies field-dressings.
1061,1061,"				GABRIEL"
1062,1062,"		It wasn't like Saratoga.  There, we"
1063,1063,"		stayed in the trees, but this time"
1064,1064,"		Gates marched us straight at the"
1065,1065,"		Redcoats.  They fired two volleys"
1066,1066,"		into us and we broke like straw.  I"
1067,1067,"		was given these dispatches... I saw"
1068,1068,"		Virginia Regulars surrender... as"
1069,1069,"		they laid down their weapons the"
1070,1070,"		British Green Dragoons rode into"
1071,1071,"		them and hacked them to bits..."
1072,1072,"		killed them all, over two hundred"
1073,1073,"		men."
1074,1074,Marion's appalled.
1075,1075,"				MARION"
1076,1076,"		They had surrendered?"
1077,1077,Gabriel nods.  Marion's stunned.  Gabriel tries to rise.
1078,1078,"				GABRIEL"
1079,1079,"		I have to get these dispatches to"
1080,1080,"		Hillsboro."
1081,1081,"				MARION"
1082,1082,"		You're in no condition to ride."
1083,1083,"				GABRIEL"
1084,1084,"		I have no choice, I..."
1085,1085,Gabriel passes out.  Marion catches him and carries him to
1086,1086,"a day-bed in the parlor.  As Marion lays him down, they"
1087,1087,"hear HEAVY MUSKET FIRE, VERY CLOSE."
1088,1088,"Marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night,"
1089,1089,"the children cluster around him, seeing a strange sight."
1090,1090,A SKIRMISH IN THE FIELD BELOW THE HOUSE
1091,1091,"Pitch black.  Then a MUSKET FIRES, creating a FLASH OF"
1092,1092,"LIGHT that illuminates a tableau of soldiers, about three"
1093,1093,dozen Redcoats and as many Patriots.
1094,1094,The strobe of the musket shot provides targets for an
1095,1095,ensuing VOLLEY OF SHOTS in every direction.  Then
1096,1096,"darkness, punctuated by SCREAMS OF PAIN, CONFUSED"
1097,1097,HOLLERING and the RUSTLING OF ARMED MEN IN MOVEMENT.
1098,1098,"Then the pattern repeats itself:  A MUSKET FIRES,"
1099,1099,illuminating a tableau of targets for another MURDEROUS
1100,1100,VOLLEY OF SHOTS.
1101,1101,"				MARION"
1102,1102,"		Margaret, take William and Susan"
1103,1103,"		down to the root cellar.  Thomas, go"
1104,1104,"		to the back porch.  Nathan and"
1105,1105,"		Samuel, the side windows.  Keep out"
1106,1106,"		of sight."
1107,1107,They hurry off.  Marion steps into the house and opens his
1108,1108,gun cabinet.  He extracts two pistols and a pair of
1109,1109,muskets.  Then he steps back to the front door.  He waits
1110,1110,and watches.
1111,1111,
1112,1112,  LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - DAWN
1113,1113,First light.  The morning mist lies low over the field.
1114,1114,Marion warily approaches the scene of the battle.  He
1115,1115,"carries a Pennsylvania rifle, has another slung over his"
1116,1116,"shoulder, and has a pair of pistols in his belt."
1117,1117,"As Marion nears the field he sees, appearing out of the"
1118,1118,"low mist, a nightmarish vision.  Young Redcoats and"
1119,1119,"Continentals are scattered on the ground, dead and"
1120,1120,wounded.  Many have been hideously torn apart by the
1121,1121,massive musket balls.  Blood is everywhere.  Marion
1122,1122,hurries back toward the house.
1123,1123,
1124,1124,  LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - MORNING
1125,1125,"Marion loads the wounded men onto a wagon, helped by"
1126,1126,"Thomas, Nathan and Samuel."
1127,1127,
1128,1128,  MARION'S HOUSE - POND BLUFF - DAY
1129,1129,The porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital.
1130,1130,"There are about two dozen wounded, a few more Patriots"
1131,1131,"than Redcoats.  Thomas, Nathan, Samuel and Margaret help"
1132,1132,Marion tend the soldiers.  William and Susan watch from
1133,1133,inside.
1134,1134,"Marion treats an arm wound, retying a tourniquet,"
1135,1135,stanching an ugly flow of blood.
1136,1136,Marion moves to the next of the wounded.  Thomas starts to
1137,1137,help but Marion shakes his head.
1138,1138,"				MARION"
1139,1139,"		He's dead..."
1140,1140,Marion moves on to another.
1141,1141,"				MARION"
1142,1142,"		Thomas, help me turn him over..."
1143,1143,They turn over a young Continental and see a horrible
1144,1144,"wound on his back.  Thomas, swoons."
1145,1145,"				MARION"
1146,1146,"		Thomas!"
1147,1147,A hard glare from Marion strengthens his son.  Together
1148,1148,they bandage the wounded man.
1149,1149,
1150,1150,  MARION'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
1151,1151,Triage completed.  Margaret and Samuel give water and
1152,1152,food.  Marion kneels next to a CONTINENTAL SERGEANT and a
1153,1153,COUPLE OF PRIVATES who are less severely wounded than the
1154,1154,others.
1155,1155,"				CONTINENTAL SERGEANT"
1156,1156,"		Thank you."
1157,1157,"Marion nods, uncomfortable with the thanks."
1158,1158,"				MARION"
1159,1159,"		Sergeant, there are seventeen"
1160,1160,"		wounded men here.  Seven Redcoats"
1161,1161,"		and ten Patriots, counting my son"
1162,1162,"		inside.  That puts me in a difficult"
1163,1163,"		position."
1164,1164,The Continental Sergeant knows what's coming.  The
1165,1165,Privates and Marion's children don't.
1166,1166,"				MARION"
1167,1167,"		You three are the least severely"
1168,1168,"		wounded.  I have to ask you to leave"
1169,1169,"		and find care elsewhere."
1170,1170,The Privates are stunned at the request.  The Sergeant
1171,1171,looks at Marion's children and nods.
1172,1172,"				SERGEANT"
1173,1173,"		I understand."
1174,1174,He struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two
1175,1175,Privates to do the same.
1176,1176,"				SERGEANT"
1177,1177,"		Come on, boys."
1178,1178,"Nathan, Samuel and Margaret are confused."
1179,1179,"				THOMAS"
1180,1180,"		Father?"
1181,1181,"				NATHAN"
1182,1182,"		But they're wounded."
1183,1183,"				MARION"
1184,1184,"		There are rules, even in war."
1185,1185,"Marion motions to a large, old scar on his arm."
1186,1186,"				MARION"
1187,1187,"		After the Battle of Ashuelot River,"
1188,1188,"		against the French, I got this and"
1189,1189,"		the one on my leg.  I couldn't walk."
1190,1190,"		Washington had to march north.  He"
1191,1191,"		left me with other wounded men and a"
1192,1192,"		like number of French prisoners."
1193,1193,"		Nine for nine.  When the French"
1194,1194,"		found us, their surgeon gave me the"
1195,1195,"		best of care.  We'll be safe this"
1196,1196,"		way."
1197,1197,Marion's children are not convinced.  The Sergeant and the
1198,1198,two Privates gather themselves to leave.
1199,1199,"				MARION"
1200,1200,"		Your best chance is in Bennington,"
1201,1201,"		seven miles east, along the river"
1202,1202,"		road."
1203,1203,The wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road.
1204,1204,"				MARION"
1205,1205,"		Thank you."
1206,1206,Marion and his children watch them go.
1207,1207,
1208,1208,  POND BLUFF ROAD - DAY
1209,1209,"A dirt road runs along the edge of the Santee Swamps,"
1210,1210,"stretching toward green, rolling hills beyond.  Beautiful"
1211,1211,"country.  Peaceful.  Then, the GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE.  A"
1212,1212,"THUNDEROUS SOUND rises, louder and louder.  HORSES HOOVES."
1213,1213,"From around a bend, a detachment of cavalry gallops:"
1214,1214,British GREEN DRAGOONS.  The finest light calvary in the
1215,1215,"world.  Hard, strong men.  Excellent horsemen.  Their"
1216,1216,"mounts are powerful, muscled and perfectly cared for.  The"
1217,1217,"Dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans, marked with"
1218,1218,the blood and dirt of a recent battle.  Tired and
1219,1219,vigorous.
1220,1220,They're armed to the teeth.  Each carries a flintlock
1221,1221,"carbine, a brace of pistols and a sword.  Some carry"
1222,1222,lances as well.  Regimental flags flutter.  They are forty
1223,1223,"of the most imposing, frightening horsemen imaginable."
1224,1224,"And at their head, the most imposing man of all, LT."
1225,1225,"COLONEL BANASTRE TARLETON.  \""The Butcher.\""  Aristocratic."
1226,1226,Strong.  Dark.  A powerful horseman on the best mount of
1227,1227,"the entire troop.  Decorated.  Imperious.  No temper, just"
1228,1228,"hard, cold authority.  His men struggle to keep up with"
1229,1229,him.
1230,1230,"Behind them, two dozen LOYALIST MILITIA CALVARY (American"
1231,1231,"civilians loyal to the crown).  Nasty, local men."
1232,1232,"Civilian clothes.  Riding at their head is AMOS GASKINS,"
1233,1233,"grizzled, lower-class, wearing ill-fitting patrician's"
1234,1234,clothing.
1235,1235,AROUND A BEND
1236,1236,The three wounded Patriots who just left Marion's farm
1237,1237,"hear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road,"
1238,1238,raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender.
1239,1239,The Green Dragoons rein in.  Tarleton stops in front of
1240,1240,the three men.  He motions for one of his men to lower his
1241,1241,"weapon.  Then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the wounded"
1242,1242,men.
1243,1243,"				TARLETON"
1244,1244,"		You're surrendering."
1245,1245,"				CONTINENTAL SERGEANT"
1246,1246,"		Yes, sir."
1247,1247,"				TARLETON"
1248,1248,"		What unit?"
1249,1249,"				CONTINENTAL SERGEANT"
1250,1250,"		First Virginia Regulars under"
1251,1251,"		Colonel Hamilton."
1252,1252,"				TARLETON"
1253,1253,"		Who cared for your wounds?"
1254,1254,They hesitate.
1255,1255,"				CONTINENTAL SERGEANT"
1256,1256,"		We did."
1257,1257,"				TARLETON"
1258,1258,"		With a lace table cloth?"
1259,1259,"Tarleton turns to his second-in-command, MAJOR WILKINS."
1260,1260,"				TARLETON"
1261,1261,"		Kill them."
1262,1262,Tarleton rides off.  Wilkins and several other Dragoons
1263,1263,"calmly FIRE THEIR PISTOLS, killing the three Patriots."
1264,1264,"The troops ride off, thundering past the bodies of the"
1265,1265,three men.
1266,1266,
1267,1267,  POND BLUFF - DAY
1268,1268,"Marion and his children tend the wounded.  Gabriel, weak"
1269,1269,"but walking, helps.  REDCOAT INFANTRY appears out of the"
1270,1270,"woods, heading toward the house.  Three dozen men.  Scouts"
1271,1271,and flank units covering the main body.  Marion gathers
1272,1272,"his family around him, stands and waits."
1273,1273,"The Redcoats get to the house, warily eye the wounded and"
1274,1274,Marion's family.  A young REDCOAT LIEUTENANT motions his
1275,1275,"men to check out the house and barn, then looks at the"
1276,1276,"wounded, doing a silent count.  He turns to Marion."
1277,1277,"				REDCOAT LIEUTENANT"
1278,1278,"		These men are of my regiment.  Thank"
1279,1279,"		you."
1280,1280,Marion nods.  ONE OF THE REDCOATS emerges from the house
1281,1281,carrying Gabriel's dispatch case.
1282,1282,"				REDCOAT"
1283,1283,"		Rebel dispatches, sir."
1284,1284,Gabriel steps up.
1285,1285,"				GABRIEL"
1286,1286,"		I carried those.  I was wounded,"
1287,1287,"		these people gave me care, they have"
1288,1288,"		nothing to do with the dispatches."
1289,1289,"				REDCOAT LIEUTENANT"
1290,1290,"		I understand."
1291,1291,The SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES.  All turn and see:
1292,1292,TARLETON AND THE GREEN DRAGOONS
1293,1293,Thundering down the road toward the house.  It's an
1294,1294,"impressive, frightening sight."
1295,1295,"They rein in their horses, stopping in the yard, enveloped"
1296,1296,by their trailing cloud of dust.
1297,1297,"Tarleton surveys the scene, then speaks to the young"
1298,1298,Redcoat Lieutenant.
1299,1299,"				TARLETON"
1300,1300,"		Lieutenant, have a detachment take"
1301,1301,"		our wounded to our surgeons at"
1302,1302,"		Camden crossing.  Use whatever"
1303,1303,"		horses and wagons you can find here."
1304,1304,"				REDCOAT LIEUTENANT"
1305,1305,"		Yes, sir."
1306,1306,He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton.
1307,1307,"				REDCOAT LIEUTENANT"
1308,1308,"		We found this, sir."
1309,1309,Tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents.
1310,1310,"				TARLETON"
1311,1311,"		Who carried this?"
1312,1312,"				GABRIEL"
1313,1313,"		I did."
1314,1314,"				TARLETON"
1315,1315,"			   (to Lt. re: Gabriel)"
1316,1316,"		Take this one to Camden, he's a spy."
1317,1317,"		He will be hung."
1318,1318,Marion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel.
1319,1319,"				MARION"
1320,1320,"		Colonel, he's a dispatch rider and"
1321,1321,"		that's a marked dispatch case."
1322,1322,Tarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to the
1323,1323,Lieutenant.
1324,1324,"				TARLETON"
1325,1325,"		Fire the house and barns."
1326,1326,"				REDCOAT LIEUTENANT"
1327,1327,"		Yes, sir."
1328,1328,"				MARION"
1329,1329,"		Colonel..."
1330,1330,"				REDCOAT LIEUTENANT"
1331,1331,"		And the Rebel wounded?"
1332,1332,"				TARLETON"
1333,1333,"		Kill them."
1334,1334,The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shocked
1335,1335,"by the order.  Marion is, also, but he's more concerned"
1336,1336,with Gabriel.  He pushes past some Redcoats and stands at
1337,1337,"Tarleton's mount, looking up."
1338,1338,"				MARION"
1339,1339,"		A dispatch rider with a marked case"
1340,1340,"		cannot be held for spying."
1341,1341,Tarleton finally pays attention to Marion.  He looks down
1342,1342,at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles.
1343,1343,"				TARLETON"
1344,1344,"		We're not going to hold him, we're"
1345,1345,"		going to hang him."
1346,1346,"				MARION"
1347,1347,"		But..."
1348,1348,Tarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion.
1349,1349,Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly
1350,1350,Redcoat Corporal.
1351,1351,"				GABRIEL"
1352,1352,"		Father..."
1353,1353,"				TARLETON"
1354,1354,"		Oh, he's your son.  You should have"
1355,1355,"		taught him about loyalty."
1356,1356,"				MARION"
1357,1357,"		Colonel, I beg you, please"
1358,1358,"		reconsider.  By the rules of war, a"
1359,1359,"		dispatch rider with a marked case..."
1360,1360,"Tarleton controls his shifting mount, keeping his pistol"
1361,1361,trained on Marion's face.
1362,1362,"				TARLETON"
1363,1363,"		Would you like a lesson in the rules"
1364,1364,"		of war?"
1365,1365,"Marion doesn't answer.  He looks up at Tarleton coldly,"
1366,1366,"taking his measure, waiting to see if he's going to pull"
1367,1367,the trigger.
1368,1368,Tarleton walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts his
1369,1369,"aim, pointing the pistol among Marion's children."
1370,1370,"				TARLETON"
1371,1371,"		Perhaps your children would."
1372,1372,The children are terrified.  Thomas is more angry than
1373,1373,frightened.  Marion quickly steps between the pistol and
1374,1374,his children and speaks quietly to Tarleton.
1375,1375,"				MARION"
1376,1376,"		No lesson is necessary."
1377,1377,Tarleton sees the terrified expressions on the faces of
1378,1378,Marion's children.  He smiles at the effect.  Then he
1379,1379,holsters his pistol.
1380,1380,Marion and his children watch as one of the Redcoats ties
1381,1381,Gabriel's hands.  Thomas is beside himself.
1382,1382,"				THOMAS"
1383,1383,"		Father, do something."
1384,1384,Thomas grows increasingly agitated.  He sees that his
1385,1385,father is going to do nothing.  He gauges the distance
1386,1386,between Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods.
1387,1387,"Then suddenly, Thomas SPRINGS.  He RUNS, THROWING HIMSELF,"
1388,1388,"into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel, KNOCKING THEM DOWN."
1389,1389,"				THOMAS"
1390,1390,"		Gabriel!  Run!"
1391,1391,Gabriel is too shocked to take flight.  A few of the
1392,1392,"Redcoats, including one of the ones knocked down, shake"
1393,1393,their heads with sad laughter at Thomas' ineffectual
1394,1394,gesture.  One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of the
1395,1395,neck and yanks him to his feet.
1396,1396,TARLETON sees the commotion.  Without pausing he DRAWS HIS
1397,1397,"PISTOL AND FIRES, HITTING THOMAS IN THE BACK."
1398,1398,"THOMAS is thrown to his knees by the shot.  Stunned,"
1399,1399,"confused, he looks down and sees the massive exit wound in"
1400,1400,his chest.
1401,1401,"MARION, horrified, catches Thomas as he falls, easing him"
1402,1402,to the ground.
1403,1403,MARGARET CRIES OUT.  THE OTHER CHILDREN are stunned to
1404,1404,silence.
1405,1405,The REDCOATS are frozen in place.  Tarleton's GREEN
1406,1406,"DRAGOONS are impassive, having seen worse."
1407,1407,"MARION holds his son, looking at the huge,"
1408,1408,incomprehensible wound.  He knows that Thomas is already
1409,1409,"dead, though his body still moves."
1410,1410,"MARION'S stunned agony turns to fury.  He rises, his eyes"
1411,1411,"trained on Tarleton, then stops as..."
1412,1412,TARLETON raises a second loaded pistol and a DOZEN GREEN
1413,1413,"DRAGOONS raise pistols and carbines, aiming them at Marion"
1414,1414,and his children.
1415,1415,"MARION FREEZES, torn between his fury and fear for his"
1416,1416,other children.  He locks his eyes on Tarleton.
1417,1417,"TARLETON calmly baths in Marion's anger.  Then, with a"
1418,1418,"hard yank of the reins, he jerks his horse's head around"
1419,1419,and utters a sharp command to Wilkins.
1420,1420,"				TARLETON"
1421,1421,"		Major."
1422,1422,Tarleton spurs his horse and rides off without looking
1423,1423,back.  His GREEN DRAGOONS THUNDER after him.
1424,1424,MARION'S CHILDREN begin to cry.  Margaret tries to revive
1425,1425,"Thomas' lifeless body, gently caressing his cheek."
1426,1426,"				MARGARET"
1427,1427,"		Thomas, please, Thomas..."
1428,1428,The Redcoats watch in silence.  MARION LOOKS AT GABRIEL
1429,1429,and turns to the Redcoat Lieutenant.   
1430,1430,"				MARION"
1431,1431,"		Lieutenant, please..."
1432,1432,"The Lieutenant wavers, but he looks after the departing"
1433,1433,Tarleton and his resolve stiffens.  He turns coldly to
1434,1434,Marion.
1435,1435,"				REDCOAT LIEUTENANT"
1436,1436,"		I have my orders.  Sergeant!"
1437,1437,"The Redcoat infantrymen scatter, some to get horses and"
1438,1438,"wagons from the barn, others to torch the buildings."
1439,1439,"MARION stands among the children, all of whom look to"
1440,1440,"Marion with pleading eyes, waiting for him to do"
1441,1441,something.
1442,1442,"				MARGARET"
1443,1443,"		Papa, look what they did to"
1444,1444,"		Thomas..."
1445,1445,"				NATHAN"
1446,1446,"		Father, they're going to take"
1447,1447,"		Gabriel..."
1448,1448,"With stone-faced fury, Marion watches the Redcoats do"
1449,1449,their work.
1450,1450,"From the barns, they hear the sounds of MUSKETS FIRING and"
1451,1451,the SQUEALS OF THE LIVESTOCK being killed.
1452,1452,"Other REDCOATS TORCH THE HOUSE, BARN AND OUTBUILDINGS."
1453,1453,THE FLAMES RISE.
1454,1454,The Redcoats bring out Marion's wagons and carriages and
1455,1455,begin loading the Redcoat wounded.
1456,1456,The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men walk among
1457,1457,"the Patriot wounded who start to struggle to their feet,"
1458,1458,"begging for mercy.  The Redcoats quickly OPEN FIRE, as if"
1459,1459,to get it over with.
1460,1460,The WOUNDED PATRIOTS CRY OUT.  More SHOTS.  Then SILENCE.
1461,1461,"GABRIEL, his hands bound behind him, looks to his father"
1462,1462,with a combination of resoluteness and fear.  Marion locks
1463,1463,eyes with him.
1464,1464,"				NATHAN"
1465,1465,"		Father, you can't let them take"
1466,1466,"		him..."
1467,1467,"				MARION"
1468,1468,"		Quiet."
1469,1469,MARION AND THE CHILDREN
1470,1470,"Watch as the Redcoats form up and move out, leading"
1471,1471,Gabriel on a tether.  Gabriel looks back helplessly but a
1472,1472,hard jerk on the rope by one of the Redcoats turns him
1473,1473,around.  They disappear around a bend in the road.
1474,1474,"THE INSTANT THE REDCOATS ARE OUT OF SIGHT, MARION speaks"
1475,1475,firmly to his weeping children.
1476,1476,"				MARION"
1477,1477,"		Don't move."
1478,1478,MARION STRIDES to his front door and ENTERS THE BURNING
1479,1479,HOUSE.
1480,1480,"INSIDE, FIRE EVERYWHERE.  Picking a route between the"
1481,1481,"flames, Marion walks to his gun cabinet.  He opens it and"
1482,1482,"pulls out weapons -- two Pennsylvania rifles, two muskets,"
1483,1483,"two pistols, a long-bladed knife and a worn tomahawk.  He"
1484,1484,"carries them, with powder horns and ammunition pouches"
1485,1485,back toward the door.
1486,1486,Marion walks OUT OF THE BURNING HOUSE.
1487,1487,"				MARION"
1488,1488,"		Nathan, Samuel..."
1489,1489,"Without breaking stride, Marion throws muskets to Nathan"
1490,1490,and Samuel who catch them.
1491,1491,"				MARION"
1492,1492,"		Margaret, take William and Susan to"
1493,1493,"		the river shed.  Hide there.  If"
1494,1494,"		we're not back by dawn, go up the"
1495,1495,"		river to the Richardson's house."
1496,1496,"		They'll take you to your Aunt"
1497,1497,"		Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel,"
1498,1498,"		and I are going to get Gabriel."
1499,1499,"				MARGARET"
1500,1500,"		But what about Thomas?"
1501,1501,"				MARION"
1502,1502,"		Leave him.  Take care of William and"
1503,1503,"		Susan."
1504,1504,"Marion runs off toward the woods, Nathan and Samuel"
1505,1505,"follow.  Margaret hesitates, then herds William and Susan"
1506,1506,toward the river.  The house is enveloped in flames.
1507,1507,
1508,1508,  WOODED PATH - AFTERNOON
1509,1509,"Marion runs, breathing hard, keeping a punishing, steady"
1510,1510,"pace.  Nathan and Samuel run behind, less winded than"
1511,1511,their father.  Marion makes up with cold fury what he
1512,1512,lacks in youth.
1513,1513,
1514,1514,  WOODED HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON
1515,1515,Marion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill.  Slows.
1516,1516,Crawls the last few feet.  Nathan and Samuel just behind
1517,1517,him.  Looks over the hillside.
1518,1518,"A path runs through a glen, about fifty feet below."
1519,1519,"Marion's eyes dart, absorbing the terrain, looking for"
1520,1520,advantage.  He points.
1521,1521,"				MARION"
1522,1522,"		Nathan, there.  Samuel, there."
1523,1523,The boys go where they're told.
1524,1524,"				MARION"
1525,1525,"		I'll fire first.  Then, Nathan, kill"
1526,1526,"		whoever is standing closest to"
1527,1527,"		Gabriel.  Samuel, kill the last man"
1528,1528,"		in the line."
1529,1529,They stagger under the weight of the orders.  Marion
1530,1530,notices but continues.
1531,1531,"				MARION"
1532,1532,"		After that, Samuel, load for Nathan."
1533,1533,"		If something happens to me, put down"
1534,1534,"		your weapons and run as fast as you"
1535,1535,"		can, that way, downhill.  Hide in"
1536,1536,"		the brush by the river, then make"
1537,1537,"		your way home, get the others and go"
1538,1538,"		to Aunt Charlotte's farm."
1539,1539,The boys hesitate.  Marion looks at them firmly.
1540,1540,"				MARION"
1541,1541,"		Boys... steady."
1542,1542,"				NATHAN & SAMUEL"
1543,1543,"		Yes, father."
1544,1544,Marion disappears into the underbrush.
1545,1545,DOWN THE PATH
1546,1546,The dozen Redcoats approach.  Leading Gabriel on the rope.
1547,1547,AHEAD OF THEM
1548,1548,Marion waits in the thick undergrowth.
1549,1549,"On the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and"
1550,1550,"exchange a frightened, troubled look."
1551,1551,The REDCOATS enter the glen.
1552,1552,"MARION waits, then picks his moment and FIRES, killing the"
1553,1553,Redcoat Lieutenant with a shot to the chest.
1554,1554,"NATHAN AND SAMUEL INSTANTLY FIRE, dropping the last"
1555,1555,Redcoat in the line and the one holding Gabriel's rope.
1556,1556,THE REDCOATS STOP in confusion...
1557,1557,"GABRIEL kneels, out of the line of fire."
1558,1558,The REDCOAT SERGEANT takes command...
1559,1559,"				REDCOAT SERGEANT"
1560,1560,"		FORM BY TWOS!  BACK-TO-BACK LINES..."
1561,1561,MARION KILLS the Sergeant with a shot to the throat...
1562,1562,"Samuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with Nathan who"
1563,1563,"FIRES, DROPPING ANOTHER REDCOAT."
1564,1564,"				REDCOAT CORPORAL"
1565,1565,"		READY..."
1566,1566,"Marion FIRES, killing the Corporal, the last man of"
1567,1567,rank...
1568,1568,Marion ducks to the side as a VOLLEY OF REDCOAT MUSKET
1569,1569,FIRE tears into the spot marked by Marion's rifle smoke...
1570,1570,"FROM THIS MOMENT ON, MARION NEVER STOPS MOVING.  He"
1571,1571,"strides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush,"
1572,1572,offering only glimpses of himself.  He changes his pace
1573,1573,"and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and"
1574,1574,loading while moving.  He never gives the Redcoats a
1575,1575,"stationary target, especially one marked by billowing"
1576,1576,smoke from his flintlock.  It's an Indian tactic and it
1577,1577,works.
1578,1578,"The Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS, about to"
1579,1579,"fire... Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD, REVERSES DIRECTION,"
1580,1580,several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS.
1581,1581,"Six Redcoats left.  Some primed, some reloading.  A"
1582,1582,REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground and
1583,1583,"FIRES, killing him."
1584,1584,"Samuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket to"
1585,1585,Nathan who FIRES...
1586,1586,The Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY
1587,1587,NATHAN'S SMOKE...
1588,1588,Marion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS.  He
1589,1589,instantly STRIDES OUT 
1590,1590," THE OPEN, drawing the Redcoats'"
1591,1591,attention from his sons...
1592,1592,"Marion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS, killing two Redcoats..."
1593,1593,"One Redcoat finishes reloading... Marion rushes him,"
1594,1594,shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with the
1595,1595,butt of the musket...
1596,1596,"This is a DIFFERENT MARION, a vicious, savage Marion,"
1597,1597,killing with stunning brutality...
1598,1598,Marion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE
1599,1599,REDCOAT'S LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shoves
1600,1600,that musket into another Redcoat's belly and FIRES...
1601,1601,"Two Redcoats left, neither finished loading..."
1602,1602,"MARION CHARGES, drawing his TOMAHAWK, ignores a GLANCING"
1603,1603,"BAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open..."
1604,1604,Splattering himself with BLOOD...
1605,1605,"The final Redcoat, a cherubic-face young man, ducks into"
1606,1606,the woods... Marion tears after him...
1607,1607,A FOOTRACE... the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THE
1608,1608,"BRUSH... the older Marion, panting, losing ground..."
1609,1609,A CLEARING... the Redcoat is almost to the cover of the
1610,1610,trees on the far side...
1611,1611,MARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air and
1612,1612,SINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK...
1613,1613,"Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks"
1614,1614,back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT...
1615,1615,"Then, without pausing, Marion wrenches the tomahawk from"
1616,1616,"the Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons..."
1617,1617,AT THE GLEN
1618,1618,"Nathan and a weeping Samuel, stunned at the carnage,"
1619,1619,stumble down the hillside toward Gabriel.  Marion runs up
1620,1620,and motions for them to stop.
1621,1621,"Marion, checks the Redcoats, making sure they're all dead."
1622,1622,"				MARION"
1623,1623,"		Samuel, reload.  Nathan, untie"
1624,1624,"		Gabriel."
1625,1625,They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket and
1626,1626,scans the road and the underbrush.  In a moment they're
1627,1627,"ready.  Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle, then he"
1628,1628,and his sons disappear into the underbrush.
1629,1629,
1630,1630,  POND BLUFF - DAY
1631,1631,The house and barns smolder.  Thomas' body lies in the
1632,1632,"yard.  Nearby, the bodies of the Patriot wounded, now"
1633,1633,dead.
1634,1634,
1635,1635,  RIVER SHED - POND BLUFF - DAY
1636,1636,Margaret waits in the shed with William and Susan.  They
1637,1637,hear a SOUND.  APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  Margaret pulls her
1638,1638,sister and brother to her and waits.
1639,1639,"The door opens.  It's Marion and Gabriel, Nathan and"
1640,1640,Samuel.  Margaret and the little ones throw themselves
1641,1641,into Marion's arms.
1642,1642,Margaret notices the blood on Marion.  She hesitates but
1643,1643,her relief tightens her embrace.
1644,1644,
1645,1645,  POND BLUFF - DAY
1646,1646,"Marion, trailed by his children, walks past the soldiers'"
1647,1647,bodies and the remains of their house.
1648,1648,He kneels down next to Thomas' body.  On the ground Marion
1649,1649,sees several of THOMAS' LEAD SOLDIERS.  He stares at them
1650,1650,"for a moment, picks them up and puts them in his pocket."
1651,1651,Marion picks up Thomas and carries him up the hill toward
1652,1652,the apple tree and Elizabeth's grave.  The children
1653,1653,follow.
1654,1654,
1655,1655,  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY
1656,1656,Marion digs a grave.  The children watch.  The only sounds
1657,1657,"are Marion's labored BREATHING, the RASP OF THE SHOVEL and"
1658,1658,the RUSTLE OF DEAD LEAVES blown along the ground by a soft
1659,1659,wind.
1660,1660,"Some dry leaves catch on Thomas' still wet blood, as if"
1661,1661,trying to bandage his wound.
1662,1662,
1663,1663,  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY (LATER)
1664,1664,Marion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave.
1665,1665,"Near tears and unsure of what to do next, he turns to"
1666,1666,Elizabeth's gravestone.  The soft wind blows.  Marion
1667,1667,listens.
1668,1668,He turns and sees his children looking up at him.  Holding
1669,1669,"in his own tears, he gathers the children around him and"
1670,1670,let's them cry.
1671,1671,"				MARION"
1672,1672,"		There, there... he's alright... he's"
1673,1673,"		with your mother now..."
1674,1674,"He stiffens, speaking formally:"
1675,1675,"				MARION"
1676,1676,"		Lord, we pray that You accept this"
1677,1677,"		child, Thomas Marion and give him a"
1678,1678,"		place at Your side with his mother."
1679,1679,"		We ask that You embrace him and help"
1680,1680,"		us to understand the manner in which"
1681,1681,"		Your mercy works.  This we ask, in"
1682,1682,"		Your name.  Amen."
1683,1683,"				MARION'S CHILDREN"
1684,1684,"		Amen."
1685,1685,"Marion looks at Elizabeth's grave, then he gently eases"
1686,1686,his children away.
1687,1687,
1688,1688,  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY
1689,1689,"Marion and his children stop at the overlook, seeing the"
1690,1690,Santee River valley spread out before them.  The SMOKE
1691,1691,from two dozen farms rises.
1692,1692,"				GABRIEL"
1693,1693,"		The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams,"
1694,1694,"		Stantons..."
1695,1695,The smoke from the separate fires joins together high in
1696,1696,"the sky, forming what looks like stormclouds.  They walk"
1697,1697,on.
1698,1698,
1699,1699,  CHARLOTTE'S FARM - NIGHT
1700,1700,Marion and his children wait in the cover of the woods.
1701,1701,They see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them
1702,1702,"from the house, Gabriel and Charlotte."
1703,1703,"				GABRIEL"
1704,1704,"		Father, it's safe."
1705,1705,Marion hustles the children out of the woods.
1706,1706,
1707,1707,  BEDROOM - NIGHT
1708,1708,"Charlotte sits, holding a sleeping Susan.  The other"
1709,1709,"children lie awake on pallets.  Marion, still streaked"
1710,1710,"with dried blood and sweat, tucks William and Margaret"
1711,1711,into bed.
1712,1712,"				MARION"
1713,1713,"		Sleep, now."
1714,1714,Marion moves on to Nathan.
1715,1715,"				NATHAN"
1716,1716,"		Father... I killed those men..."
1717,1717,"				MARION"
1718,1718,"		Don't blame yourself, you did what I"
1719,1719,"		told you to do."
1720,1720,"				NATHAN"
1721,1721,"		I'm glad I killed them... I'm"
1722,1722,"		glad..."
1723,1723,Marion isn't.  He turns to Samuel who's cried-out.  Marion
1724,1724,reaches out to touch him but Samuel recoils from Marion's
1725,1725,blood-streaked hand.  Marion sighs and tucks him in.
1726,1726,"				MARION"
1727,1727,"		Try to get some sleep."
1728,1728,Marion moves to take Susan from Charlotte who shakes her
1729,1729,head.
1730,1730,"				CHARLOTTE"
1731,1731,"		I'll stay with them."
1732,1732,Marion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children.
1733,1733,
1734,1734,  CHARLOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
1735,1735,Marion enters.  He starts to pace but grows unsteady.  He
1736,1736,rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his
1737,1737,"mouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children are"
1738,1738,searching for the solace of sleep.
1739,1739,"He opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, pours"
1740,1740,and drinks.  Then another.
1741,1741,THE SOUND OF HORSEMEN.  Gabriel walks in.  Tired.  Grim.
1742,1742,"				GABRIEL"
1743,1743,"		How are they?"
1744,1744,Marion just shakes his head.
1745,1745,"				GABRIEL"
1746,1746,"		Gates is at Hillsboro with the"
1747,1747,"		Continental Army.  I'll leave in the"
1748,1748,"		morning to join him."
1749,1749,Marion nods.  Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for a
1750,1750,"long moment, neither one finding words.  Then Gabriel"
1751,1751,speaks softly.
1752,1752,"				GABRIEL"
1753,1753,"		I'll tend my horse."
1754,1754,He leaves Marion alone.
1755,1755,
1756,1756,  CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)
1757,1757,Marion stares at the fireplace.  Charlotte walks in
1758,1758,carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing.
1759,1759,"				CHARLOTTE"
1760,1760,"		They're asleep."
1761,1761,Marion is silent.  Charlotte pours water into a washbowl
1762,1762,and motions to Marion.  He takes off his shirt.  She
1763,1763,begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on
1764,1764,his neck.
1765,1765,"				MARION"
1766,1766,"		How did this... how did I let this"
1767,1767,"		happen?"
1768,1768,"				CHARLOTTE"
1769,1769,"		You couldn't have known."
1770,1770,"				MARION"
1771,1771,"		I should have known... once I would"
1772,1772,"		have... I used to be wary... and"
1773,1773,"		today I watched my son killed before"
1774,1774,"		my eyes... your sister civilized me"
1775,1775,"		and I damn myself for having let"
1776,1776,"		her..."
1777,1777,"				CHARLOTTE"
1778,1778,"		Thomas is dead but you've done"
1779,1779,"		nothing for which you should be"
1780,1780,"		ashamed."
1781,1781,"				MARION"
1782,1782,"		I've done nothing and for that I am"
1783,1783,"		ashamed."
1784,1784,She looks at him closely.
1785,1785,"				CHARLOTTE"
1786,1786,"		If you go, I'll care for them as if"
1787,1787,"		they were my own."
1788,1788,"				MARION"
1789,1789,"		I'll leave in the morning with"
1790,1790,"		Gabriel."
1791,1791,"He stares past her, looking at the flames in the"
1792,1792,fireplace.  She tends his wounds.
1793,1793,
1794,1794,  PORCH - CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - MORNING
1795,1795,Marion and Gabriel finish saddling their horses.  Marion
1796,1796,"embraces Nathan and Samuel.  Then he turns to Margaret,"
1797,1797,William and Susan.
1798,1798,"				WILLIAM"
1799,1799,"		When will you be back?"
1800,1800,"				MARION"
1801,1801,"		I don't know, William."
1802,1802,"				WILLIAM"
1803,1803,"		Tomorrow?"
1804,1804,Marion winces.  Margaret puts her arm around William.
1805,1805,"				MARGARET"
1806,1806,"		No, not tomorrow."
1807,1807,"Marion kisses them both, then moves on to Susan, trying to"
1808,1808,coax a word out of the silent four-year-old:
1809,1809,"				MARION"
1810,1810,"		Goodbye?"
1811,1811,She just looks at him.
1812,1812,"				MARION"
1813,1813,"		Just one word?  Goodbye?  That's all"
1814,1814,"		I want."
1815,1815,"Susan shakes her head.  He sighs, rises and turns to"
1816,1816,"Charlotte.  They hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeply"
1817,1817,"but a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a moment"
1818,1818,longer than one would expect.  She looks up at him... he
1819,1819,kisses her on the cheek.
1820,1820,"Marion mounts up.  And he and Gabriel head off, Susan,"
1821,1821,"unnoticed and unheard, whispers:"
1822,1822,"				SUSAN"
1823,1823,"		Goodbye."
1824,1824,Marion and Gabriel ride away.
1825,1825,
1826,1826,  CAMDEN ROAD - DAY
1827,1827,Marion and Gabriel ride past the signs of a small
1828,1828,skirmish.  Bodies.  Abandoned wagons.  Dead horses.  A
1829,1829,burning farm.
1830,1830,
1831,1831,  CAMDEN HILLSIDE - DAY
1832,1832,Marion and Gabriel ride to the crest of a hill.  A vista
1833,1833,spreads out before them.  They see an awesome sight -- A
1834,1834,MASSIVE SLASH OF RED approaches a MASSIVE SLASH OF BLUE.
1835,1835,A battle is taking place about five miles away.
1836,1836,Gabriel starts to spur his horse but Marion restrains him.
1837,1837,"				MARION"
1838,1838,"		No, it's too late."
1839,1839,Gabriel stops.  Marion points out brightly colored
1840,1840,clusters of men behind each army.
1841,1841,"				MARION"
1842,1842,"		Command posts... Patriot..."
1843,1843,"		British..."
1844,1844,The distant slash of red stops.  Marion and Gabriel hear
1845,1845,only a GENTLE WIND and some nearby SONGBIRDS.
1846,1846,"Then, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, a"
1847,1847,"sudden, silent eruption of white smoke."
1848,1848,"An instant later, the blue slash quivers.  A moment later"
1849,1849,"the SOUND OF THE CANNONS, RUMBLES UP THE HILL and rolls"
1850,1850,over Marion and Gabriel.
1851,1851,The RED SLASH STOPS moving.  It darkens as thousands of
1852,1852,Redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel
1853,1853,into firing position.
1854,1854,Marion's eyes dart.  He knows what's coming.
1855,1855,"				MARION"
1856,1856,"		Break for the trees... break for the"
1857,1857,"		trees..."
1858,1858,A MASSIVE ERUPTION OF WHITE SMOKE billows from the red
1859,1859,"slash.  An instant later, the blue line starts to break up"
1860,1860,as hundreds of distant Patriots fall.
1861,1861,The SOUND OF THE BRITISH MUSKETS reaches Marion and
1862,1862,Gabriel like the pattering of rain.
1863,1863,"Then the SMOKE OF INEFFECTIVE, SCATTERED VOLLEYS erupts"
1864,1864,from the Patriot lines.  The red line holds firm.
1865,1865,"				MARION"
1866,1866,"		Send them to cover!  Goddamn you!"
1867,1867,But the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field.
1868,1868,"From behind the Redcoats, FAST-MOVING GREEN AND RED MASSES"
1869,1869,move quickly onto the battlefield.  CAVALRY.
1870,1870,"				GABRIEL"
1871,1871,"		Father, we have to do something..."
1872,1872,"The British cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering"
1873,1873,it.  Tiny bits of blue move in every direction.
1874,1874,"				GABRIEL"
1875,1875,"		Father..."
1876,1876,"				MARION"
1877,1877,"		It's already over."
1878,1878,"Marion watches, appalled.  At this distance the moving"
1879,1879,slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely
1880,1880,beautiful.  Marion turns his horse and heads down the
1881,1881,"hill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines."
1882,1882,
1883,1883,  AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
1884,1884,"A nightmare.  SCREAMS OF AGONY.  A few hundred battered,"
1885,1885,Patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move
1886,1886,"out.  The battle, so bloodless and beautiful at a"
1887,1887,"distance, has, in its aftermath, become horrifically"
1888,1888,painful and ugly.
1889,1889,"Marion and Gabriel ride into camp, passing nervous"
1890,1890,sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools
1891,1891,of blood and amputated legs and arms.  Marion sees HARRY
1892,1892,"LEE at a make-shift command post, barking orders, trying"
1893,1893,to pull things together.
1894,1894,"				LEE"
1895,1895,"		Damn you, Sergeant, don't move the"
1896,1896,"		wounded twice, put them straight on"
1897,1897,"		the wagons from the surgeons."
1898,1898,"				PATRIOT SERGEANT"
1899,1899,"		Yes, sir."
1900,1900,"				LEE"
1901,1901,"		Lieutenant, detail men for"
1902,1902,"		outriders.  We move out as soon as"
1903,1903,"		the wounded are ready."
1904,1904,"				LIEUTENANT"
1905,1905,"		Yes, sir."
1906,1906,The Lieutenant rushes off.  Lee notices Marion and
1907,1907,"Gabriel, surprised to see them.  He jerks his head for"
1908,1908,them to follow him into:
1909,1909,LEE'S COMMAND TENT
1910,1910,"Once out of sight of the men, Lee loses his command"
1911,1911,"bearing.  Exhausted, he leans on his campaign table and"
1912,1912,"looks closely at Marion, asking with his eyes why Marion"
1913,1913,is here.
1914,1914,"				MARION"
1915,1915,"		Green Dragoons came to my home,"
1916,1916,"		killed my son, Thomas.  It was"
1917,1917,"		Tarleton himself."
1918,1918,"				LEE"
1919,1919,"		I'm sorry."
1920,1920,"				MARION"
1921,1921,"		I'm sorry I wasn't here for this."
1922,1922,"				LEE"
1923,1923,"		There's nothing you could have done,"
1924,1924,"		Gates is a damned fool."
1925,1925,"				MARION"
1926,1926,"		We saw."
1927,1927,"				LEE"
1928,1928,"		I begged him to stay in the cover of"
1929,1929,"		the trees but he insisted the only"
1930,1930,"		way to break Cornwallis was muzzle-"
1931,1931,"		to-muzzle.  He spent too many years"
1932,1932,"		in the British army."
1933,1933,"				MARION"
1934,1934,"		Where is he now?"
1935,1935,"				LEE"
1936,1936,"		Last anyone saw, riding hard,"
1937,1937,"		northeast, his staff a hundred yards"
1938,1938,"		behind, trying to catch up."
1939,1939,"				MARION"
1940,1940,"		Who's in command?"
1941,1941,"				LEE"
1942,1942,"		I am, I think."
1943,1943,"				MARION"
1944,1944,"		What are my orders?"
1945,1945,Lee gives Marion a tired smile.
1946,1946,"				LEE"
1947,1947,"		If you want orders, I've got some"
1948,1948,"		for you."
1949,1949,Lee ROLLS OUT A MAP for Marion and Gabriel.
1950,1950,"				LEE"
1951,1951,"		We're a breath away from losing this"
1952,1952,"		war.  In the North, Washington is"
1953,1953,"		reeling from Valley Forge, running"
1954,1954,"		and hiding from Clinton and twelve"
1955,1955,"		thousand Redcoats."
1956,1956,"			   (pointing)"
1957,1957,"		Here in the South, Cornwallis has"
1958,1958,"		broken our back.  He captured over"
1959,1959,"		five thousand of our troops when he"
1960,1960,"		took Charleston and today he"
1961,1961,"		destroyed the only army that stood"
1962,1962,"		between him and New York."
1963,1963,"				MARION"
1964,1964,"		So now Cornwallis will head north,"
1965,1965,"		link up with Clinton and finish off"
1966,1966,"		Washington."
1967,1967,"				LEE"
1968,1968,"		And Patriots will start dying on the"

1970,1970,"			   (beat)"
1971,1971,"		Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the"
1972,1972,"		South until the French arrive.  A"
1973,1973,"		treaty was signed at Versailles"
1974,1974,"		after our victory at Saratoga.  The"
1975,1975,"		French are sending a fleet and ten"

1977,1977,"				MARION"
1978,1978,"		When?"

1983,1983,"				LEE"
1984,1984,"		The bigger problem is where, not"
1985,1985,"		when.  The French fleet won't sail"
1986,1986,"		north of the Chesapeake for fear of"
1987,1987,"		early storms."
1988,1988,"				MARION"
1989,1989,"		So you're going to try to keep"
1990,1990,"		Cornwallis in the South until then."
1991,1991,"				LEE"
1992,1992,"		Not me, you.  I'm going north with"

1996,1996,"				MARION"
1997,1997,"		You expect Cornwallis to be held"
1998,1998,"		here by militia?"
1999,1999,"				LEE"

2001,2001,"				MARION"
2002,2002,"		They're nothing but farmers and"
2003,2003,"		you're asking them to try to keep a"

2006,2006,"				LEE"

2053,2053,"		Colonel, I didn't request this"

2116,2116,"		I'll be sure to do that."
2117,2117,As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of
2118,2118,Madeira on one of the tables.  He stops.
2119,2119,"				MARION"
2120,2120,"		I'll wait.  Miracles happen."
2121,2121,"A stand-off.  Then, a hulking FIGURE appears in the"
2122,2122,"shadows at the back doorway.  He's JOHN BILLINGS, big,"
2123,2123,"coarse, about Marion's age.  Billings jerks his head for"
2124,2124,Marion to join him in the back room.
2125,2125,

2147,2147,"		What about you?  You've got a lot to"

2149,2149,Marion drains his glass and stands up.
2150,2150,"				MARION"
2151,2151,"		You coming, or not?"
2152,2152,Billings drains his glass.  They walk out together.

2158,2158,  SNOW'S ISLAND - SANTEE SWAMPS - NIGHT
2159,2159,A CACOPHONY OF BIRDS AND INSECTS.  Swamp maples and
2160,2160,willows form a canopy over moss-covered mounds and pools
2161,2161,of plant-choked water.
2162,2162,"Gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that"
2163,2163,snakes through the swamp.  They cross a narrow land bridge
2164,2164,"onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men,"
2165,2165,including Marion who kneels at a campfire.
2166,2166,CLOSE SHOT:  Several of Thomas' brightly painted LEAD
2167,2167,SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan.  The little men fall to
2168,2168,"their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten"
2169,2169,metal.
2170,2170,The new arrivals dismount and greet the others.
2171,2171,Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours the
2172,2172,"lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold"
2173,2173,into a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS.
2174,2174,"				GABRIEL"
2175,2175,"		Father, this war is about more than"

2177,2177,Marion doesn't look up.
2178,2178,"				MARION"
2179,2179,"		Is it?"
2180,2180,"				GABRIEL"
2181,2181,"		If you're here only for revenge,"

2185,2185,"		How old are you?"

2187,2187,"		You know how old I am."
2188,2188,"				MARION"
2189,2189,"		God help us all when you're forty."
2190,2190,Marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan.  Gabriel
2191,2191,"shakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse."
2192,2192,
2193,2193,  SNOW'S ISLAND ENCAMPMENT - MORNING
2194,2194,"Day breaks.  A low, thick swamp mist covers the"
2195,2195,"encampment.  Marion, sits alone by the embers of last"
2196,2196,"night's campfire.  The men are awake.  Some eat, others"
2197,2197,talk.
2198,2198,Marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie.  He takes
2199,2199,the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch
2200,2200,attached to his weapons' belt.  Then he rises and heads
2201,2201,over to the men.
2202,2202,"He surveys his brigade.  Twenty-six men:  framers,"
2203,2203,"artisans, mountain men, none in uniform.  Marion walks"
2204,2204,"among them, nodding familiarly to several.  He notices an"
2205,2205,"imposing looking Cherokee Indian, BROTHER JOSEPH, standing"
2206,2206,a bit apart from the others.  They exchange nods.
2207,2207,"He notices a stern-looking man in partial clerical garb,"
2208,2208,REV. CHARLES OLIVER.

2210,2210,"		Reverend."
2211,2211,"				REV. OLIVER"
2212,2212,"		I heard about your son.  I'm sorry."
2213,2213,"Marion accepts his condolences.  He notes GEORGE DALTON, a"

2215,2215,"				MARION"
2216,2216,"		Dalton."
2217,2217,"Dalton doesn't respond.  Marion recognizes another face,"
2218,2218,"ABNER BROWN, African-American, around thirty, rugged."
2219,2219,Marion addresses the men who do not gather around so much
2220,2220,as just give him their attention.
2221,2221,"				MARION"
2222,2222,"		You all have your own reasons for"
2223,2223,"		being here.  I lost a son and I"

2225,2225,"		him..."
2226,2226,Marion pauses and looks over at Gabriel.
2227,2227,"				MARION"
2228,2228,"		... But I don't consider that man's"

2233,2233,"Gabriel nods, approvingly."
2234,2234,"				MARION"
2235,2235,"		Cornwallis has to move north.  We"
2236,2236,"		have to keep him right here.  If"
2237,2237,"		he's south of the Chesapeake when"
2238,2238,"		the French arrive, if the French"
2239,2239,"		arrive, we have a chance of winning"
2240,2240,"		this war."
2241,2241,Marion looks from face to face.
2242,2242,"				MARION"
2243,2243,"		Eat, get some rest, we move out in"
2244,2244,"		two hours."
2245,2245,"Marion heads back to his campsite, passing Gabriel without"
2246,2246,"looking at him, but very aware of his son's eyes on him."

2249,2249,A massive British army field encampment.  Thousands of
2250,2250,"well-armed, veteran troops.  Large detachments of Redcoats"

2253,2253,"TARLETON and his GREEN DRAGOONS, covered with dirt and"

2291,2291,"		bulk of our supplies will reach us"
2292,2292,"		by sea, through Charleston, which"
2293,2293,"		will give us a long and vulnerable"

2303,2303,"		Nonetheless, we must remember that"

2428,2428,Marion's men tend their wounded and look through the
2429,2429,"British wagons, taking inventory."

2437,2437,Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and
2438,2438,"ROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen.  They"
2439,2439,"overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of"
2440,2440,colonial artisans.

2471,2471,"		That's why he's a colonel."
2472,2472,Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work.
2473,2473,Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN
2474,2474,and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE
2475,2475,GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons.
2476,2476,"				BILLINGS"
2477,2477,"		Shoot them!  Shoot the damn things!"
2478,2478,Dalton prepares to do so.

2482,2482,"		They followed us from the bridge."

2485,2485,"Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the"
2486,2486,dogs.
2487,2487,"				MARION"
2488,2488,"		Stay... stay... stay..."
2489,2489,The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out his
2490,2490,throat.
2491,2491,"				MARION"
2492,2492,"		Don't you growl at me!"
2493,2493,"The dogs decide to obey.  Marion lets them sniff his hand,"
2494,2494,then firmly pats them.
2495,2495,"				MARION"
2496,2496,"		Now let's see what's in this wagon."
2497,2497,Rev. Oliver and Abner join him.  Billings eases past the
2498,2498,dogs.  Abner opens a large case and finds it filled with
2499,2499,bottles.

2503,2503,"				BILLINGS"
2504,2504,"		No wonder they were guarding it."
2505,2505,Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered
2506,2506,"wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig-"
2507,2507,stands.  Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical cases
2508,2508,and finds it filled with papers.
2509,2509,"				REV. OLIVER"
2510,2510,"		My heavens, personal correspondence"
2511,2511,"		of... Lord Cornwallis."
2512,2512,"Marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matching"
2513,2513,cases on nearby wagons.
2514,2514,"				MARION"
2515,2515,"		These four wagons must be his."
2516,2516,"				GABRIEL"
2517,2517,"		And the dogs, too, I'll wager."
2518,2518,"				BILLINGS"
2519,2519,"		I say we drink the wine, shoot the"

2530,2530,"Ignoring Abner, Marion, sits down on a stump with a pile"
2531,2531,of Cornwallis' papers and starts to read.
2532,2532,
2533,2533,  SNOW'S ISLAND - NIGHT
2534,2534,"Marion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk,"
2535,2535,"reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis'"
2536,2536,"field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil"
2537,2537,paintings and an elaborate folding commode.  The TWO GREAT
2538,2538,"DANES sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily."
2539,2539,"The men have divided themselves into two groups, one"
2540,2540,"coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a"
2541,2541,separate fire.
2542,2542,"The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph and"
2543,2543,"RANDOLPH, a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drink"
2544,2544,"and laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew."
2545,2545,"The civilized men, including Rev. Oliver, Gabriel, Scott,"
2546,2546,"Fielding and Abner, talk quietly."
2547,2547,Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the
2548,2548,campfire where the rougher men are gathered.  He stands
2549,2549,"just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all"
2550,2550,can hear:
2551,2551,"				MARION"
2552,2552,"		Today was hard earned but a good"
2553,2553,"		start."
2554,2554,"Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men as"
2555,2555,well.
2556,2556,"				MARION"
2557,2557,"		In the future wounded British"
2558,2558,"		soldiers will be given quarters."
2559,2559,"				DALTON"
2560,2560,"		Like they gave quarter to my family?"
2561,2561,"		My wife and three children were"
2562,2562,"		hiding in our root cellar when they"
2563,2563,"		came.  The Redcoats locked the door"
2564,2564,"		and torched the house."
2565,2565,"				MARION"
2566,2566,"		You have my sympathy... but the"
2567,2567,"		order stands."
2568,2568,"				DALTON"
2569,2569,"		And who are you to give an order"
2570,2570,"		like that?  We all know what you did"
2571,2571,"		after Fort Wilderness."
2572,2572,That hits home but Marion remains calm.
2573,2573,"				MARION"
2574,2574,"		I'm your commanding officer.  This"
2575,2575,"		is militia, not regular army.  I"
2576,2576,"		can't hold you here, but as long as"
2577,2577,"		you stay, you'll follow my orders."
2578,2578,Marion looks from face to face.  Most begrudgingly nod.
2579,2579,That's enough for Marion.
2580,2580,As he heads back to his own campfire he's intercepted by
2581,2581,Rev. Oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other
2582,2582,"men, except for Gabriel and Billings who overhear."
2583,2583,"				REV. OLIVER"
2584,2584,"		Thank you."
2585,2585,"				MARION"
2586,2586,"		For what?"
2587,2587,"				REV. OLIVER"
2588,2588,"		For trying to impose some decency on"
2589,2589,"		that sort."
2590,2590,"				MARION"
2591,2591,"		Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one"
2592,2592,"		of that sort."
2593,2593,Marion walks on.  Rev. Oliver exchanges a look with
2594,2594,"Gabriel, then heads off.  As Marion joins Gabriel and"
2595,2595,"Billings at his campfire, Billings grips his bottle."
2596,2596,"				BILLINGS"
2597,2597,"		Am I one of that sort?"
2598,2598,"				MARION"
2599,2599,"		You're the worst of that sort."
2600,2600,"		You're the sort that gives that sort"
2601,2601,"		a bad name."
2602,2602,"Billings considers that, then shrugs and takes a long"
2603,2603,drink.  He hands the bottle to Marion who takes an equally
2604,2604,long drink.  Marion picks up his Pennsylvania rifle.
2605,2605,"				MARION"
2606,2606,"		I'm going to check the watch."
2607,2607,He disappears into the darkness leaving Gabriel and
2608,2608,Billings at the campfire.
2609,2609,"				GABRIEL"
2610,2610,"		He shouldn't make light.  That"
2611,2611,"		Redcoat should not have been killed."
2612,2612,"				BILLINGS"
2613,2613,"		He's not making light."
2614,2614,Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look.
2615,2615,"				BILLINGS"
2616,2616,"		You don't know him very well, do"
2617,2617,"		you?"
2618,2618,"				GABRIEL"
2619,2619,"		He's my father."
2620,2620,Billings looks closely at Gabriel.
2621,2621,"				GABRIEL"
2622,2622,"		I know him well enough?"
2623,2623,"				BILLINGS"
2624,2624,"		Don't fault him for having grown up"
2625,2625,"		on the frontier.  It was a harder"
2626,2626,"		time and a harder place than you"
2627,2627,"		know."
2628,2628,"Gabriel looks at Billings, then turns back to the fire."
2629,2629,
2630,2630,  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAWN
2631,2631,"The men are beginning to stir, gathering around the"
2632,2632,"campfires, cooking, using pots, pans and other gear from"
2633,2633,the stolen British wagons.
2634,2634,"Marion reads Cornwallis' journal.  He looks up, stretches"
2635,2635,"and walks over to a campfire where Gabriel, Billings and"
2636,2636,Rev. Oliver cook.  The dogs follow at a distance.
2637,2637,"				BILLINGS"
2638,2638,"		Well?"
2639,2639,"				MARION"
2640,2640,"		I've just been inside the mind of a"
2641,2641,"		genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more"
2642,2642,"		about war than I could in a dozen"
2643,2643,"		lifetimes."
2644,2644,"				BILLINGS"
2645,2645,"		Cheerful news to greet the morn."
2646,2646,"				MARION"
2647,2647,"		His victories at Charleston and"
2648,2648,"		Camden were perfect, strategically,"
2649,2649,"		tactically, logistically.  But he"
2650,2650,"		has a weakness."
2651,2651,They all turn to Marion.
2652,2652,"				MARION"
2653,2653,"		Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His"
2654,2654,"		weakness is that he knows it."
2655,2655,"				GABRIEL"
2656,2656,"		Father?"
2657,2657,"				MARION"
2658,2658,"		Pride is his weakness."
2659,2659,The men consider that.
2660,2660,"				BILLINGS"
2661,2661,"		Personally, I'd prefer stupidity."
2662,2662,"				MARION"

2672,2672,"   the ground as if by magic, having been camouflaged by"

2674,2674,"   which holds for a moment, then flees."

2680,2680,   large haul of stolen British supply wagons.  The booty

2689,2689,   Cornwallis angrily mounts up and rides off.  His
2690,2690,   contrite staff officers mount up and follow.
2691,2691,-- Snow's Island.  Marion sits with his muddy feet on
2692,2692,"   Cornwallis' campaign desk, reading Cornwallis' journal,"
2693,2693,   with Cornwallis' Great Danes at his side.

2712,2712,"				CORNWALLIS"
2713,2713,"		Why, after six weeks, are we still"
2714,2714,"		here to attend a ball.  By now, we"

2773,2773,"out of a side-street, SINGING A MUMBLING SONG.  The"

2786,2786,Billings and Dalton walk over to the Redcoats guards.  As
2787,2787,"the guards reach for the bottles, Billings SLAMS one of"

2794,2794,"Marion and Scott duck into the shadows of the doorway,"

2796,2796,silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of
2797,2797,the heavy door.
2798,2798,Billings and Dalton take the posts of the guards while the
2799,2799,other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight.

2803,2803,Grand.  Opulent.  Cornwallis speaks with a small gathering
2804,2804,"of loyalist civilians, among whom is the spectacular MRS."
2805,2805,"TALBOT, who wears a daring dress that reveals an enormous"
2806,2806,expanse of bosom.  At her side stands her toady of a
2807,2807,"husband, MR. TALBOT."
2808,2808,"				MRS. TALBOT"
2809,2809,"		No!  The beasts took your dogs, as"

2811,2811,"				CORNWALLIS"
2812,2812,"		Fine animals, a gift from His"

2814,2814,"				MRS. TALBOT"
2815,2815,"		Is there no decency?"
2816,2816,"				MR. TALBOT"
2817,2817,"		Among the rebels?  We know the"
2818,2818,"		answer to that."

2823,2823,  CAMDEN ARMORY - NIGHT
2824,2824,Marion and Scott shove their chisels through the door
2825,2825,which falls away from the hinges.  They all duck inside
2826,2826,"finding barrels and casks of gunpowder, boxes of weapons"
2827,2827,and hundreds of muskets.
2828,2828,Gabriel and the others load themselves up with the best of
2829,2829,the weapons as Marion opens a cask and pours a trail of
2830,2830,gunpowder across the floor.

2833,2833,"Cornwallis, taking the night air with Mrs. Talbot, gazes"
2834,2834,"at the moon, achieving the calculated effect."
2835,2835,"				MRS. TALBOT"
2836,2836,"		You seem far away."
2837,2837,"				CORNWALLIS"

2841,2841,"			   (with a self-"
2842,2842,"			    deprecating laugh)"
2843,2843,"		... and long gazes at the moon."
2844,2844,Mrs. Talbot sympathetically sighs and touches her
2845,2845,fingertips to her heart which is conveniently located
2846,2846,inches above her stunning cleavage.   
2847,2847,"				MRS. TALBOT"
2848,2848,"		Oh, you poor man..."
2849,2849,A MASSIVE EXPLOSION LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT as a FIREBALL
2850,2850,"erupts from the armory.  British officers, including Major"
2851,2851,"Halbert and Tarleton, RUSH OUT along with Mr. Talbot and"
2852,2852,other Loyalist civilians.
2853,2853,"				MAJOR HALBERT"
2854,2854,"		Good God!"
2855,2855,Mr. Talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks at
2856,2856,"his wife, clinging to Cornwallis' arm."
2857,2857,"				MR. TALBOT"
2858,2858,"		These rebels seem to lack fear as"
2859,2859,"		well as decency, eh, General?"
2860,2860,"Cornwallis registers the insult, glances at the hapless"
2861,2861,"Major Halbert, then turns to Tarleton."
2862,2862,"				CORNWALLIS"
2863,2863,"		Colonel Tarleton, you deal with"
2864,2864,"		these damned rebels."
2865,2865,"				TARLETON"

2887,2887,"Green's daughter, ANNE, very attractive, around sixteen,"
2888,2888,joins them.  Gabriel sees her and sidles over.

2892,2892,"				MARION"

2894,2894,Gabriel clears his throat.  Anne looks at him coolly.
2895,2895,"				ANNE"
2896,2896,"		I know who you are, Gabriel Marion."
2897,2897,"		The last time I saw you, I was nine"

2907,2907,"				GREEN"
2908,2908,"		He's sorry.  Come."
2909,2909,Green heads across the square where some townspeople are
2910,2910,giving Marion's men provisions.  Anne and Gabriel follow.
2911,2911,"Marion turns to some waiting men, new recruits."
2912,2912,"Billings, nearby, reads A POSTED BROADSHEET that"
2913,2913,"announces:  \""Reward Offered:  For the capture or death of"
2914,2914,"the rebel known as 'The Swamp Fox'\""."
2915,2915,He tears it down and walks over to Marion.
2916,2916,"				MARION"
2917,2917,"		... and your terms of enlistment"
2918,2918,"		will be month-to-month.  Every"

2921,2921,"REED, the sturdiest of the lot offers his hand to Marion."
2922,2922,"				REED"
2923,2923,"		I'm in."
2924,2924,The others nod in agreement.
2925,2925,"				MARION"
2926,2926,"		Talk to Abner and Scott about"
2927,2927,"		provisions, powder and mounts."
2928,2928,The recruits head off.  Billings hands Marion the wanted
2929,2929,poster which Marion glances at and crumbles up.
2930,2930,"				BILLINGS"
2931,2931,"		Twenty men here, seventeen in New"

2935,2935,ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE
2936,2936,Gabriel and several of Marion's men take supplies from
2937,2937,"Green, Anne, and some other townspeople.  Gabriel looks at"
2938,2938,Anne.
2939,2939,"				GABRIEL"
2940,2940,"		If I'd known you were going to look"
2941,2941,"		like this, I never would have put"

2943,2943,"				ANNE"
2944,2944,"		You call that a compliment?"
2945,2945,"				GABRIEL"
2946,2946,"		It's a start."
2947,2947,She gives him a bit of a smile.  He checks out her teeth.
2948,2948,"				GABRIEL"
2949,2949,"		They look nice.  As white as can be."
2950,2950,She tries to glare but she can't help but laugh.
2951,2951,MARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel some
2952,2952,"apples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catching"
2953,2953,"them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a"
2954,2954,disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again.  Marion
2955,2955,smiles at his son's flirtation.  Billings smiles as well.
2956,2956,"				BILLINGS"
2957,2957,"		He reminds me of you before you got"
2958,2958,"		old and ugly."

2960,2960,"			   (softly)"
2961,2961,"		No, he takes after his mother..."
2962,2962,Billings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marion's
2963,2963,words.
2964,2964,"				MARION"
2965,2965,"		... the younger ones barely remember"
2966,2966,"		her but Gabriel spent more time with"
2967,2967,"		Elizabeth... she taught him well,"
2968,2968,"		guided him, she was his North Star"
2969,2969,"		and mine... her father was a"
2970,2970,"		minister, in Boston, did you know"
2971,2971,"		that?"
2972,2972,Billings nods.
2973,2973,"				MARION"
2974,2974,"		... Gabriel's already a better man"
2975,2975,"		than I could ever hope to be..."
2976,2976,"Marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel,"
2977,2977,"adopting a coarse, joking tone."
2978,2978,"				MARION"
2979,2979,"		What do you mean, old and ugly?"
2980,2980,"				BILLINGS"
2981,2981,"		You got me beat on both accounts."
2982,2982,"				MARION"
2983,2983,"		The hell I do."
2984,2984,"They mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind."
2985,2985,Gabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off.  He
2986,2986,"says goodbye to Anne, then RUNS TO HIS HORSE, MOUNTING"
2987,2987,"WITH A DRAMATIC LEAP.  He GALLOPS up, taking his place at"
2988,2988,"his father's side.  Marion doesn't turn to look at him,"
2989,2989,but he knows he's there.

2991,2991,  CAROLINA ROAD - DAY
2992,2992,A patchwork of fields with a village visible in the
2993,2993,"distance.  The ROLLINS BOYS, 10 and 12, work a field,"
2994,2994,"harvesting grain.  Hearing the SOUND OF HORSES' HOOVES,"
2995,2995,they stop and listen.
2996,2996,Then they see a CLOUD OF DUST rising over the ridge line.
2997,2997,"Growing excited, they throw down their scythes and race"
2998,2998,"down the hillside, madly stumbling and falling, trying to"
2999,2999,intersect the approaching sound.
3000,3000,"At the bottom of the hill they pass their father, BEN"
3001,3001,"ROLLINS, who watches his sons plant themselves on the side"
3002,3002,"of the road, gazing in awe at:"
3003,3003,"MARION AND HIS MEN, THUNDERING BY.  They're an impressive"
3004,3004,"sight, a hundred-and-fifty heavily armed men, on powerful"
3005,3005,"mounts, raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the"
3006,3006,road.

3008,3008,  CHARLESTON ROAD - DAY
3009,3009,"Marion and forty of his men, including Gabriel, sit on"
3010,3010,their motionless horses in the middle of the road.  There
3011,3011,"are a number of new faces among Marion's men, among them"
3012,3012,Ben Rollins.  Gabriel is lost in thought.
3013,3013,"				MARION"
3014,3014,"		Gabriel?  Are you asleep?"
3015,3015,"				GABRIEL"
3016,3016,"		We're low on salt.  I should go to"

3019,3019,"		You got salt last week."

3027,3027,"		You went to Pembroke and got five"

3029,3029,"Gabriel sighs.  They hear a SOUND APPROACHING, then see"
3030,3030,two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX
3031,3031,"REDCOATS, commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT.  The Redcoat"
3032,3032,Sergeant signals stop.
3033,3033,"				REDCOAT SERGEANT"
3034,3034,"		Halt.  Look alive, boys."

3037,3037,"				MARION"
3038,3038,"		Sergeant, this road is closed."
3039,3039,"		Those wagons now belong to the"

3041,3041,"				REDCOAT SERGEANT"
3042,3042,"		Ready arms!  By twos!"
3043,3043,Marion's surprised by the Sergeant's order.
3044,3044,"				MARION"
3045,3045,"		Sergeant, there's no reason for you"
3046,3046,"		and your men to die.  Just leave the"

3048,3048,"				REDCOAT SERGEANT"
3049,3049,"		Steady, boys..."
3050,3050,Marion sighs and lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE.  The

3057,3057,"		Prepare to fire."
3058,3058,"Marion exchanges a look with Rev. Oliver who, like Marion,"
3059,3059,"doesn't want to kill these men.  Seeing no other option,"
3060,3060,"Marion turns to give the order, then stops, hearing a"
3061,3061,FA
3062,3062,"BARELY DETECTABLE, RUMBLING SOUND..."
3063,3063,A moment later Brother Joseph hears it as well... HORSES

3065,3065,THUNDERING toward them from the road behind the British
3066,3066,wagons...

3126,3126,"YANKS, brings the rider off his horse, grabs the reins and"

3168,3168,swarming mosquitoes...
3169,3169,"The exhausted Dragoons are wet, covered with mud, and"
3170,3170,bleeding from swamp briars.  The horses are spent and
3171,3171,foaming...
3172,3172,"Tarleton struggles harder than any, but finally even he"
3173,3173,has had enough.  He reins back his horse.
3174,3174,"				TARLETON"
3175,3175,"		HALT!"
3176,3176,Tarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant-
3177,3177,choked water and swamp...
3178,3178,"				TARLETON"
3179,3179,"		Enough of this.  There are other"
3180,3180,"		ways to run down a fox."
3181,3181,"Tarleton yanks on his reins, turns his horse and starts"
3182,3182,back the way they came.  His grateful men turn their
3183,3183,horses and follow.
3184,3184,"IN THE UNDERGROWTH, Marion, Gabriel, Billings and three"
3185,3185,"badly wounded men, with only four horses between them,"
3186,3186,calm their mounts...
3187,3187,"They can hear, but not see the Dragoons.  Then, through"
3188,3188,"the thick undergrowth, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF"
3189,3189,TARLETON...
3190,3190,"Gabriel, tending the wounded men, sees his father lock his"
3191,3191,eyes on Tarleton...
3192,3192,Marion quickly opens his weapons pouch and pulls out one
3193,3193,of the bullets he made from Thomas' lead soldiers.
3194,3194,"Walking to his horse, Marion loads..."
3195,3195,"Marion mounts, scanning the terrain, planning a route..."
3196,3196,"				GABRIEL"
3197,3197,"		Father, no..."
3198,3198,"As Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton, Gabriel"
3199,3199,"grabs the bridle.  He YANKS HARD, stopping Marion's horse"
3200,3200,"dead.  THE HORSE BUCKS, nearly throwing Marion..."
3201,3201,"				MARION"
3202,3202,"		That's him.  Tarleton."
3203,3203,MARION SPURS THE HORSE which tries to respond but is
3204,3204,JERKED BACK AGAIN by Gabriel.  Marion angrily turns on his
3205,3205,son...
3206,3206,"				MARION"
3207,3207,"		Damn you!  Let go!"
3208,3208,"Gabriel looks up at his father, never loosening his iron"
3209,3209,"grip on the bridles but speaking softly, almost"
3210,3210,pleadingly:
3211,3211,"				GABRIEL"
3212,3212,"		Father, please..."
3213,3213,Marion looks down at Gabriel.  Then Marion looks over at
3214,3214,Billings and the three wounded men...
3215,3215,One bleeds from an ugly neck wound... their shared mounts
3216,3216,are nearly spent...
3217,3217,Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing
3218,3218,Tarleton.  Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the
3219,3219,"wounded.  Gabriel watches his father for a moment, then"
3220,3220,joins him with the wounded.
3221,3221,
3222,3222,  WOODED GLEN - NIGHT
3223,3223,"Dark.  Marion and his battered men gather, taking stock."
3224,3224,"Men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, past"
3225,3225,"wary sentries.  GABRIEL RIDES UP, dismounts and reports to"
3226,3226,"Marion, out of earshot of the other men."
3227,3227,"				GABRIEL"
3228,3228,"		Fourteen dead, eleven wounded,"
3229,3229,"		eighteen captured."
3230,3230,"				MARION"
3231,3231,"		I should have killed him when I had"
3232,3232,"		the chance?"
3233,3233,"				GABRIEL"
3234,3234,"		When was that?  In the swamp at the"
3235,3235,"		expense of your men?  Or when he"
3236,3236,"		killed Thomas at the expense of your"
3237,3237,"		family?"
3238,3238,"				MARION"
3239,3239,"		No..."
3240,3240,"				GABRIEL"
3241,3241,"		Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense"
3242,3242,"		of our cause."
3243,3243,Marion is silent.
3244,3244,"				GABRIEL"
3245,3245,"		There will be a time and a place for"
3246,3246,"		revenge but killing Tarleton at the"
3247,3247,"		expense of your duty serves no one"
3248,3248,"		but yourself."
3249,3249,"			   (beat)"
3250,3250,"		Stay the course."
3251,3251,The parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words brings
3252,3252,a thin smile to Marion's face.
3253,3253,"				MARION"
3254,3254,"		Stay the course... your mother used"
3255,3255,"		to say that to me when I'd get drunk"
3256,3256,"		or lose my temper."
3257,3257,"				GABRIEL"
3258,3258,"		She'd say it to me when I picked on"
3259,3259,"		Thomas or Nathan."
3260,3260,"				MARION"
3261,3261,"		You learned her lessons better than"
3262,3262,"		I."
3263,3263,"				GABRIEL"
3264,3264,"		She got me at a more impressionable"
3265,3265,"		age."
3266,3266,"Marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads"
3267,3267,over to help with the wounded.

3270,3270,"A cold, winter rain falls.  Most of Marion's grim men are"
3271,3271,huddled in lean-to's and around campfires.  Green and
3272,3272,several other Pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of
3273,3273,"supplies while Marion, Scott and Fielding stow the"
3274,3274,provisions.

3279,3279,"		Next time we'll bring more blankets."
3280,3280,"				GABRIEL"
3281,3281,"		That would be nice."

3283,3283,"		Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and"
3284,3284,"		have just rain, no snow."
3285,3285,"				GABRIEL"
3286,3286,"		That would be nice, too."
3287,3287,She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of
3288,3288,tea.
3289,3289,"				ANNE"
3290,3290,"		Just because the French didn't come"
3291,3291,"		this fall, doesn't mean they're"
3292,3292,"		never going to come."
3293,3293,He nods and takes a drink of the tea.  She smiles.
3294,3294,"Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink-"
3295,3295,"stained, black teeth.  Before she has time to laugh..."
3296,3296,ROLLINS RIDES HARD

3304,3304,"Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel.  He is, however,"
3305,3305,taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth.  Gabriel notices
3306,3306,everyone looking at his mouth.
3307,3307,"Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in"

3319,3319,A temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeered
3320,3320,farmhouse.  Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor
3321,3321,measures him and marks alterations on a partially
3322,3322,completed uniform.  Tarleton enters.
3323,3323,"				TARLETON"
3324,3324,"		General, a message from the"

3338,3338,Oliver who carries a white flag.
3339,3339,"A detachment of Redcoat Cavalry, lead by Major Halbert,"
3340,3340,waits.  The Redcoats fall in on either side.  They ride
3341,3341,on.

3383,3383,"ALONE, EXCEPT FOR THE DOGS, allows himself a fleeting"
3384,3384,smile.  Then he looks around the room.  He notes a rocking

3386,3386,"down, sits and rocks.  The dogs walk over and lay at his"

3388,3388,
3389,3389,  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY (LATER)
3390,3390,Marion patiently sits rocking.  One of the dogs has its

3395,3395,"A stone-faced Marion stands in the center of the room,"
3396,3396,"playing with the dogs.  One of the dogs jumps up, putting"
3397,3397,"its front legs on Marion's shoulders, and licks his face."
3398,3398,"Just then, Cornwallis walks in, overjoyed to see his dogs."

3400,3400,"		Jupiter!  Mars!"
3401,3401,"The dogs just look at Cornwallis.  He holds out his arms,"

3404,3404,"				MARION"
3405,3405,"		Go."
3406,3406,The dogs run to Cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly
3407,3407,but not enthusiastic manner.  Cornwallis pats them
3408,3408,"vigorously, too vigorously for the moderate level of joy"

3433,3433,"		Colonel... Colonel Banastre"

3437,3437,"		Colonel."
3438,3438,"Marion, like ice, looks Tarleton up and down.  Then he"
3439,3439,"slowly turns and looks at the four Dragoons, two on either"
3440,3440,side of Tarleton.  Marion measures the odds and finds them
3441,3441,wanting.
3442,3442,"With a supreme effort of will, Marion forces himself to"

3445,3445,"		Shall we proceed?"

3465,3465,"		Unless you would like to claim"

3467,3467,Cornwallis is surprised.  He exchanges a look with
3468,3468,Tarleton.
3469,3469,"				CORNWALLIS"
3470,3470,"		You are familiar with how these"

3479,3479,"		furniture and personal effects of a"

3482,3482,"				MARION"
3483,3483,"		I will do so as soon as possible."

3490,3490,"				CORNWALLIS"
3491,3491,"		Apology accepted.  Now, on the"

3494,3494,"		absolutely unacceptable."
3495,3495,"				MARION"
3496,3496,"		That one is a bit more difficult."
3497,3497,"				CORNWALLIS"
3498,3498,"		Certainly you must know that in"

3503,3503,"				MARION"
3504,3504,"		And what are inappropriate levels of"

3506,3506,"				CORNWALLIS"
3507,3507,"		Colonel, imagine the utter chaos"
3508,3508,"		that would result from un-led armies"

3513,3513,"				MARION"
3514,3514,"		Restrain them from the targeting of"

3517,3517,"				CORNWALLIS"
3518,3518,"		That is a separate issue."
3519,3519,"				MARION"
3520,3520,"		I consider them linked."
3521,3521,"				CORNWALLIS"
3522,3522,"		I beg to differ.  One is a command"

3529,3529,"				MARION"
3530,3530,"		As long as your soldiers attack"

3546,3546,"				CORNWALLIS"
3547,3547,"		I do have eighteen criminals under"

3550,3550,"				MARION"
3551,3551,"		If that's your position, then"

3555,3555,"				CORNWALLIS"
3556,3556,"		What officers?"
3557,3557,"Marion steps to the window, checks the view.  A wooded"
3558,3558,hillside is visible in the distance.  Marion reaches into

3560,3560,The Dragoons move on him...
3561,3561,"Marion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which he"
3562,3562,hands to Cornwallis.
3563,3563,"				MARION"
3564,3564,"		In the clearing, just down from the"
3565,3565,"		crest, to the left of the dark"
3566,3566,"		pines..."
3567,3567,Cornwallis looks through the spyglass.
3568,3568,VIEW THROUGH THE SPYGLASS
3569,3569,Though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering
3570,3570,"haze, Cornwallis can just make out a row of bound Redcoat"
3571,3571,"officers, with Patriot soldiers holding muskets at their"
3572,3572,heads.
3573,3573,CORNWALLIS turns coldly to Marion.
3574,3574,"				CORNWALLIS"
3575,3575,"		Their names, ranks and posts?"
3576,3576,"				MARION"
3577,3577,"		They refused to give me their names."
3578,3578,"		Their ranks are nine lieutenants,"
3579,3579,"		five captains, three majors and one"
3580,3580,"		fat colonel who called me a cheeky"
3581,3581,"		fellow.  Their posts?  We picked"
3582,3582,"		them up here-and-there last night."
3583,3583,Cornwallis glares at Marion.
3584,3584,"				CORNWALLIS"
3585,3585,"		You are not a gentleman."
3586,3586,Marion can't help but laugh at the insult.
3587,3587,"				MARION"
3588,3588,"		If your conduct is the measure of a"
3589,3589,"		gentleman, I take that as a"
3590,3590,"		compliment."
3591,3591,"			   (coldly)"
3592,3592,"		Get my men."
3593,3593,Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington.
3594,3594,"				CORNWALLIS"
3595,3595,"		Arrange the exchange."
3596,3596,Colonel Huntington leaves to do so.
3597,3597,"				MARION"
3598,3598,"		Thank you, General.  I'm sure your"
3599,3599,"		officers will thank you, as well."
3600,3600,Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute.
3601,3601,THEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON.  He walks up to him and
3602,3602,looks him in the eye.
3603,3603,"				MARION"
3604,3604,"		You don't remember me, do you?"
3605,3605,"Tarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, but"
3606,3606,unable to place him... then Tarleton remembers...
3607,3607,"				TARLETON"
3608,3608,"		Ah, yes, that boy."
3609,3609,Tarleton calmly holds Marion's glare.
3610,3610,"				TARLETON"
3611,3611,"		Ugly business, doing one's duty."
3612,3612,"				MARION"
3613,3613,"		Yes, ugly business."
3614,3614,"Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks very"
3615,3615,"softly, very slowly, very clearly."
3616,3616,"				MARION"
3617,3617,"		If you are alive when this war is"
3618,3618,"		over, I'm going to kill you."
3619,3619,Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly
3620,3620,clear that he means what he says.  Tarleton tries to cover
3621,3621,his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by
3622,3622,Marion's icy words.
3623,3623,Marion turns and walks out.  The two Great Danes start to
3624,3624,"follow, but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND:"
3625,3625,"				CORNWALLIS"
3626,3626,"		Jupiter!  Mars!"
3627,3627,"THE DOGS FREEZE, looking after Marion, who doesn't turn"
3628,3628,back.  The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis'
3629,3629,side.
3630,3630,
3631,3631,  ASSEMBLY YARD - FORT CAROLINA - DAY
3632,3632,"Redcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting.  His"
3633,3633,eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and
3634,3634,"directed to waiting horses.  Surprised to be freed, they"
3635,3635,mount up.
3636,3636,CORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch of
3637,3637,Cornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his men
3638,3638,ride toward the gate.
3639,3639,"THE TWO GREAT DANES, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side."
3640,3640,Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THE
3641,3641,"GATES.  They do so and Marion and his men, without"
3642,3642,"hurrying, ride out."
3643,3643,"Then, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion,"
3644,3644,"without turning around, lets loose with a PIERCING"
3645,3645,WHISTLE...
3646,3646,"THE TWO GREAT DANES INSTANTLY RACE AFTER MARION, making it"
3647,3647,through the gates just as they're closing.
3648,3648,"CORNWALLIS, seeing his dogs run after Marion, SPUTTERS,"
3649,3649,then turns and storms back into his quarters.
3650,3650,"TARLETON, still off-balance from Marion's parting"
3651,3651,"statement, watches Marion ride away.  Then he turns to"
3652,3652,Major Wilkins who stands nearby.
3653,3653,"				TARLETON"
3654,3654,"		Take a detachment and go get our"

3656,3656,Wilkins hurries off.

3659,3659,Major Wilkins and a detachment of Green Dragoons ride up
3660,3660,the wooded slope toward the bound Redcoat officers that
3661,3661,Cornwallis saw through the spyglass.  As the Dragoons ride
3662,3662,"out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead, seeing"
3663,3663,that:
3664,3664,"THE \""REDCOAT OFFICERS\"" are not real -- they're nothing"
3665,3665,more than SCARECROWS IN REDCOAT UNIFORMS.  There's no sign

3690,3690,A thick ground fog surrounds Charlotte's house.  The soft
3691,3691,lights of candles glow in the windows.  All appears
3692,3692,peaceful.
3693,3693,"Then, the SHADOWED FIGURES of THREE DOZEN GREEN DRAGOONS"
3694,3694,"appear out of the mist, silently approaching the house on"

3697,3697,  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
3698,3698,A fire crackles in the fireplace.  A curtain blows in the

3700,3700,"Dragoons pour into the house, muskets brandished.  No sign"

3715,3715,
3716,3716,  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
3717,3717,A TORCH BURNS.  A dozen Dragoons light torches off of it
3718,3718,and fan out to search.  The thick fog turns the torches
3719,3719,"into diffused, floating balls of light, turning the"
3720,3720,Dragoons into ghost-like apparitions.
3721,3721,"CAMERA FOLLOWS ONE OF THE TORCHES, carried by a"
3722,3722,particularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge of
3723,3723,"the underbrush closest to the house.  As the torch moves,"
3724,3724,its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the
3725,3725,underbrush...
3726,3726,"The CAMERA STOPS to reveal, in the brush, TWO FACES,"
3727,3727,"GABRIEL AND CHARLOTTE, dark, motionless, watching the"

3733,3733,"AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE, the torches converge,"
3734,3734,illuminating Tarleton who gives the unheard order.  The
3735,3735,"torches fan out and begin SETTING FIRE TO THE HOUSE, BARNS"
3736,3736,AND OUTBUILDINGS.
3737,3737,MARGARET grips Charlotte's arm.  Gabriel motions and they
3738,3738,"all ease back, disappearing into the brush."

3744,3744,"and Gabriel, flanked by Aaron and Abigail, Marion's"
3745,3745,"middle-aged, black servants, seen in the opening sequence,"
3746,3746,"talk with several stern-looking, middle-aged, black"
3747,3747,FREEDMEN.
3748,3748,"The conversation, which is out of the children's earshot,"
3749,3749,"is testy, with one of the middle-aged freedmen"
3750,3750,particularly troubled.
3751,3751,"Marion's stone-faced children look around, appraising"
3752,3752,"their surroundings, registering the poverty of the shanty"

3754,3754,THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE GROWN-UPS ends with a guarded
3755,3755,"exchange of handshakes.  Gabriel, Charlotte, Abner, Aaron"
3756,3756,and Abigail rejoin the children and Marion's men.
3757,3757,"				GABRIEL"
3758,3758,"		It's all set."
3759,3759,"They follow Aaron, down an alley to A SHACK.  Small."
3760,3760,"Barely standing.  The children stop in their tracks,"
3761,3761,knowing this is to be their new home.
3762,3762,Charlotte sees their hesitation.  She walks up to the
3763,3763,"little structure, examining it with a critical eye.  She"
3764,3764,"looks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor,"
3765,3765,"wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude,"
3766,3766,chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall.  She smiles.
3767,3767,"				CHARLOTTE"
3768,3768,"		This will do fine."
3769,3769,She turns to Aaron and Abigail.
3770,3770,"				CHARLOTTE"
3771,3771,"		Thank you."
3772,3772,Charlotte walks inside without looking back.  The children
3773,3773,"hesitate, then follow her inside."

3775,3775,  SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT
3776,3776,The children help Aaron and Abigail make beds out of

3784,3784,"				CHARLOTTE"

3794,3794,"			   (beat)"
3795,3795,"		How is he?"
3796,3796,Gabriel searches for an honest answer.
3797,3797,"				GABRIEL"
3798,3798,"		I don't know... I'm his son."
3799,3799,"Gabriel steps over to his saddlebags, opens his pack and"
3800,3800,pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to Charlotte.
3801,3801,"				GABRIEL"
3802,3802,"		These are for you and the children."
3803,3803,They sense someone behind them.
3804,3804,"				SUSAN"
3805,3805,"		Why didn't father come?"
3806,3806,Gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his
3807,3807,"heretofore silent sister.  Charlotte nods, smiling."
3808,3808,"				CHARLOTTE"
3809,3809,"		Speaking for months now."

3816,3816,"		He left us."
3817,3817,"				GABRIEL"
3818,3818,"		I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll"
3819,3819,"		come back as soon as he can."
3820,3820,"Susan says nothing.  Gabriel continues, hopefully."
3821,3821,"				GABRIEL"
3822,3822,"		There are some letters here from"

3824,3824,"				SUSAN"
3825,3825,"		I don't care.  I hate him."

3828,3828,"				SUSAN"
3829,3829,"		Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he"
3830,3830,"		never comes back."
3831,3831,Gabriel kneels down and embraces her.  She stands coldly
3832,3832,with her arms at her sides.

3845,3845,"				MARION"
3846,3846,"		Tell me everything she said, word"

3848,3848,Gabriel hesitates.
3849,3849,"				GABRIEL"
3850,3850,"		She said... she loves you and misses"

3853,3853,"				MARION"
3854,3854,"		She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said"

3856,3856,Gabriel nods.
3857,3857,"				MARION"
3858,3858,"		Isn't that something."
3859,3859,"Marion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself."
3860,3860,"Gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject."
3861,3861,"				GABRIEL"

3885,3885,"				MARION"
3886,3886,"		I'd be honored."
3887,3887,"They share a moment, then head down the aisle.  Marion"
3888,3888,"greets Anne's parents, shaking hands with her father and"
3889,3889,"bowing to her mother.  Abner, at the door, nods that the"

3899,3899,"In the shadows behind the church, the bride and groom say"

3954,3954,"Cornwallis, with his command staff clustered around him,"
3955,3955,sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch
3956,3956,"rider waits.  They're on a hillside, looking over the"
3957,3957,burned-out remains of a small British fort as some
3958,3958,Redcoats pull the Union Jack out of a trench latrine.
3959,3959,Cornwallis motions Tarleton and they ride a few yards from
3960,3960,"the other officers and speak, out of earshot."

4024,4024,  SMALL FARMHOUSE - SUNSET
4025,4025,Tarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a
4026,4026,"farmhouse, looking out at a lovely sunset, absentmindedly"
4027,4027,picking at the petals of some wildflowers.  A HIDEOUS
4028,4028,SCREAM pierces the calm.
4029,4029,"Tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream,"
4030,4030,"then rises, passing several Green Dragoons who wait with"
4031,4031,their horses in front of the farmhouse.
4032,4032,"				TARLETON"
4033,4033,"		I believe they are almost ready."
4034,4034,IN THE FARMHOUSE
4035,4035,"Blood is smeared on one wall, where half-a-dozen corpses"
4036,4036,lie in a jumbles mass on the floor.
4037,4037,"In the parlor, Tarleton walks past more bodies, including"
4038,4038,a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over
4039,4039,"the bloody bodies of her two young children, both under"
4040,4040,eight-years-old.
4041,4041,"In the kitchen, Tarleton finds Wilkins, some Green"
4042,4042,"Dragoons, and Gaskins, the Loyalist Militia commander and"
4043,4043,some of his low-life men.
4044,4044,"Rob Fielding, one of the craftsmen in Marion's force, is"
4045,4045,"tied, spread-eagle to the table, showing the terrible"
4046,4046,effects of PROTRACTED TORTURE.  Wilkins and Gaskins are
4047,4047,nervous and apologetic as Tarleton walks into the room.
4048,4048,"				GASKINS"
4049,4049,"		I'm sorry, sir.  He died."
4050,4050,"Tarleton sighs, irritated."
4051,4051,"				TARLETON"
4052,4052,"		Very well, get one of the others."
4053,4053,Gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached
4054,4054,"woodshed where Billings sits, bound.  They roughly grab"
4055,4055,him and drag him into the kitchen.
4056,4056,"				BILLINGS"
4057,4057,"		Damn your eyes.  Do your worst."
4058,4058,"				TARLETON"
4059,4059,"		I intend to."

4061,4061,
4062,4062,  SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY
4063,4063,Silence.  A tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank in
4064,4064,"the floor, disappearing into a gap between two"
4065,4065,floorboards.
4066,4066,"Marion, Dalton, Rev. Oliver, and several other men walk"
4067,4067,"slowly through the farmhouse, in stunned silence."
4068,4068,"Marion sees the body of the mother, draped over her two"
4069,4069,young children.  Marion turns to Rev. Oliver who can only
4070,4070,"stare, offering no solace."
4071,4071,"They pass Fielding's body, then enter the kitchen and see"
4072,4072,"BILLINGS, DEAD, still tied to the table.  Marion reels."
4073,4073,
4074,4074,  SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY
4075,4075,Marion's men dig graves.  Marion watches.  Dalton steps up
4076,4076,next to him.
4077,4077,"				DALTON"
4078,4078,"		You still want me to give wounded"
4079,4079,"		Redcoats quarter?"
4080,4080,Marion doesn't answer.  Gabriel GALLOPS up.  He reins back
4081,4081,his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting.
4082,4082,"				GABRIEL"
4083,4083,"		Tarleton has a list of our men, most"
4084,4084,"		are on it.  A regiment of dragoons"

4086,4086,"		burning them, killing whomever"
4087,4087,"		resists, women and children, as"
4088,4088,"		well."
4089,4089,"				MARION"
4090,4090,"		Where?"

4092,4092,"		Seven homes along the Black River so"
4093,4093,"		far..."
4094,4094,"Rollins doesn't pause.  He rushes to his horse, mounts up"
4095,4095,and rides off.  Marion and the other men mount up and ride
4096,4096,off fast after him.
4097,4097,
4098,4098,  BLACK RIVER ROAD - DAY
4099,4099,Marion his brigade catch up to Rollins and ride on with
4100,4100,him.
4101,4101,
4102,4102,  ROLLINS' FARM - DAY
4103,4103,"The small farm seen earlier, surrounded by hills, where"
4104,4104,"the two boys, Rollins' sons ran down the hillside to catch"
4105,4105,a glimpse of the passing Marion and his brigade.
4106,4106,"The house smolders.  No sign of life.  Gabriel, Abner and"
4107,4107,a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared
4108,4108,area around the house.
4109,4109,"Marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits next"
4110,4110,"to an increasingly frantic, Rollins.  They see Gabriel"
4111,4111,"wave, signaling all clear."
4112,4112,"MARION, ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house."
4113,4113,"Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES.  Horrified, he"
4114,4114,"reins back and dismounts, almost falling."
4115,4115,"His TWO SONS, WIFE, an OLDER MAN and WOMAN, lie dead in"
4116,4116,the dirt.  Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony.
4117,4117,"Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner,"
4118,4118,"as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being"
4119,4119,jerked by a drunken puppeteer.
4120,4120,Marion and Rev. Oliver dismount and move toward him.
4121,4121,Rollins sees them coming.  He hardens and strides to his
4122,4122,"horse, pulling his FL"
4123,4123,OCK PISTOL from his saddle
4124,4124,holster.
4125,4125,Rev. Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins.
4126,4126,"				REV. OLIVER"
4127,4127,"		It's not time for vengeance, it's"
4128,4128,"		time to mourn and..."
4129,4129,"ROLLINS PUTS THE PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER,"
4130,4130,BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT.
4131,4131,Every man freezes in place.  For a long moment no one
4132,4132,"moves, no one speaks.  Then Marion pulls himself together"
4133,4133,and addresses the men:
4134,4134,"				MARION"
4135,4135,"		Five day furlough for all men."
4136,4136,"		Abner, Dan, Reverend, spread the"
4137,4137,"		word.  We'll reform at Acworth.  Any"
4138,4138,"		man who doesn't come back won't be"
4139,4139,"		thought a coward or uncommitted to"
4140,4140,"		the cause.  Attend to your families."
4141,4141,The men mount up.  Marion and Gabriel ride off together.
4142,4142,
4143,4143,  PEMBROKE - NIGHT
4144,4144,Marion scans the night as Gabriel and Anne mount up.  The
4145,4145,"three of them ride off, pulling a line of horses, some"
4146,4146,heavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but empty
4147,4147,mounts.
4148,4148,
4149,4149,  SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT
4150,4150,Dark.  Quiet.  Gabriel and Anne wait in the shadows while
4151,4151,"Marion cocks his musket, checks his pistols and walks"
4152,4152,slowly toward the shack.
4153,4153,He warily checks every shadow.  No one anywhere.  Then a
4154,4154,"SOUND -- A SQUEAL OF LAUGHTER, immediately followed by:"
4155,4155,"				MARGARET (O.S.)"
4156,4156,"		It's him!  I told you it was him!"
4157,4157,MARION'S CHILDREN RACE OUT OF THE SHADOWS to Marion.  He's
4158,4158,"practically bowled over as Margaret, Nathan, Samuel and"
4159,4159,William fling themselves into his arms.
4160,4160,"				NATHAN"
4161,4161,"		Father!"
4162,4162,"				WILLIAM"
4163,4163,"		Papa..."
4164,4164,"CHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, watching the reunion"
4165,4165,"as Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug"
4166,4166,all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll
4167,4167,never let go.  MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over the
4168,4168,heads of the children.
4169,4169,"				MARION"
4170,4170,"		Thank you."
4171,4171,Charlotte smiles.  Then Marion notices SUSAN peeking out
4172,4172,from behind Charlotte's patched and mended skirt.  He
4173,4173,kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't
4174,4174,move.
4175,4175,He smiles to her and speaks softly:
4176,4176,"				MARION"
4177,4177,"		Susan..."
4178,4178,"She looks coldly at Marion, tightens her grip on"
4179,4179,Charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her.  Marion
4180,4180,looks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance.
4181,4181,Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces
4182,4182,of his other children.
4183,4183,
4184,4184,  CHERAW FALLS PATH - NIGHT
4185,4185,"Marion rides, leading his children, Charlotte and Anne up"
4186,4186,"a steep, narrow path that cuts through a heavily wooded"
4187,4187,hillside.
4188,4188,
4189,4189,  CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT
4190,4190,The remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm.  The
4191,4191,"house is gone, leaving only an overgrown cellar hole."
4192,4192,"Nearby is a barely-standing tobacco shed, one end of which"
4193,4193,has fallen to the ground.  A SOFT WIND WHISTLES AND
4194,4194,WHISPERS through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of the
4195,4195,structure.
4196,4196,Marion rides up to the edge of the clearing.  A
4197,4197,"MOCKINGBIRD SCREECHES nearby, startling him.  He looks"
4198,4198,"back at the children, worried, anticipating a negative"
4199,4199,reaction.  Margaret smiles and turns to the other
4200,4200,"children, speaking for Marion's benefit."
4201,4201,"				MARGARET"
4202,4202,"		I told you, things would get better."
4203,4203,The children smile and dismount.
4204,4204,
4205,4205,  TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT
4206,4206,"POURING RAIN.  The ceiling drips.  Marion lies, awake,"
4207,4207,"with his children huddled against him, sleeping in one of"
4208,4208,the few dry spots.  They're covered with tattered quilts.
4209,4209,"On the other side of the children, Charlotte is also"
4210,4210,"awake.  She and Marion exchange a long, silent look in the"
4211,4211,"darkness, over the heads of the sleeping children."
4212,4212,
4213,4213,  WATERFALL OVERLOOK - DAY
4214,4214,Marion walks the perimeter of their encampment with Nathan
4215,4215,and Samuel.  They listen carefully.
4216,4216,"				MARION"
4217,4217,"		The overlook, up there should be"

4227,4227,"		Now let's find someplace to cache"
4228,4228,"		extra weapons..."
4229,4229,They follow Marion like soldiers.
4230,4230,
4231,4231,  CHERAW FALLS - DAY
4232,4232,Marion sits on a rock while Margaret cuts his hair.  She
4233,4233,"takes her time, touching him on the head and shoulders,"
4234,4234,"extending the process.  Marion, sits back, enjoying it."
4235,4235,"He notices Susan, nearby, watching silently.  He smiles."
4236,4236,She turns away.
4237,4237,
4238,4238,  TOBACCO SHED - CHERAW FALLS - DAY
4239,4239,Dark.  Shafts of light shine in through the holes in the
4240,4240,"roof.  Marion, standing in the shadows, senses someone"
4241,4241,coming.  He freezes.
4242,4242,A figure rounds the corner.  It's... William.  MARION
4243,4243,"YELLS William SQUEALS IN DELIGHT, then chases his father"
4244,4244,"around the corner, tagging him.  They laugh.  Marion"
4245,4245,covers his eyes and William dashes off to hide.
4246,4246,
4247,4247,  CHERAW FALLS - RIVERSIDE - DAY
4248,4248,Marion sits on the side of the river with Susan who avoids
4249,4249,looking at him.  Using the knife we've seen him use in
4250,4250,battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them.
4251,4251,"				MARION"
4252,4252,"		Good apple."
4253,4253,No response.
4254,4254,"				MARION"
4255,4255,"		Very good.  Sweet."
4256,4256,He cuts a slice and offers it to her.  She doesn't take
4257,4257,it.  He puts the slice between them.  After a long moment
4258,4258,"she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops,"
4259,4259,seeing something on it.  She puts it back.
4260,4260,Marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red
4261,4261,splotch on it.  He looks at his knife and realizes that
4262,4262,it's dried blood.
4263,4263,"Off-balance, he turns to Susan who stares straight ahead,"
4264,4264,a thousand miles from Marion.
4265,4265,
4266,4266,  CHERAW FALLS RIVER - DAY
4267,4267,"Marion washes the knife carefully, almost obsessively."
4268,4268,Anne steps up behind him.
4269,4269,"				ANNE"
4270,4270,"		May I ask you a question?"
4271,4271,Marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without
4272,4272,explanation.
4273,4273,"				MARION"
4274,4274,"		Yes, of course."
4275,4275,"She speaks with a sly, withheld smile."
4276,4276,"				ANNE"
4277,4277,"		Do you think Frances with an \""e\"" is"
4278,4278,"		too manly a name for a girl?"
4279,4279,"				MARION"
4280,4280,"		No."
4281,4281,"				ANNE"
4282,4282,"		Do you think Francis with an \""i\"" is"

4284,4284,"				MARION"
4285,4285,"		No."
4286,4286,"				ANNE"
4287,4287,"		Good."
4288,4288,Anne smiles and walks away.  Marion figures out what she
4289,4289,just told him.
4290,4290,"				MARION"
4291,4291,"		When?"
4292,4292,"				ANNE"

4301,4301,Marion's children swim and play with the two Great Danes
4302,4302,"in the pond at the base of the falls, along with Gabriel"
4303,4303,"and Anne.  Marion and Charlotte sit on the bank, watching"
4304,4304,them.
4305,4305,Charlotte turns and looks at Marion for a long moment.
4306,4306,"He's unaware.  As Charlotte looks at him, her smile"
4307,4307,"disappears, replaced by anger.  She snaps at Marion."
4308,4308,"				CHARLOTTE"
4309,4309,"		I'm not my sister."
4310,4310,"Startled, Marion turns to Charlotte."

4312,4312,"		Excuse me?"

4319,4319,"				MARION"
4320,4320,"		Of course, I do."
4321,4321,"				CHARLOTTE"
4322,4322,"			   (irritated)"
4323,4323,"		Very well, then."
4324,4324,"She turns from him.  Marion, tries to figure out what just"
4325,4325,happened.  After a long moment he gets it.  Stunned at
4326,4326,"first, his gears turn.  After a very thoughtful moment he"
4327,4327,turns to Charlotte and offers a tentative smile.  She
4328,4328,rolls her eyes.
4329,4329,
4330,4330,  CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT
4331,4331,Dark.  A full moon shines.
4332,4332,
4333,4333,  TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT
4334,4334,Marion wakes.  He looks across his sleeping children and
4335,4335,sees that Charlotte isn't in her place on the other side
4336,4336,of them.  He rises and walks out into the night.
4337,4337,
4338,4338,  GLEN - CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT
4339,4339,"Marion walks into the glen.  He tenses, sensing someone in"
4340,4340,front of him.  Then he sees CHARLOTTE AT THE EDGE OF THE
4341,4341,WOODS.  Neither one speaks...
4342,4342,"They walk silently to each other.  They stop, looking at"
4343,4343,"each other closely, as if seeing one another for the first"
4344,4344,time...
4345,4345,Only then do they kiss.  The kiss grows more passionate...
4346,4346,then much more passionate...
4347,4347,
4348,4348,  CHERAW FALLS - DAY
4349,4349,Marion finishes tying his gear onto his horse.  The
4350,4350,children are silent.  He stands beside his horse.  One
4351,4351,"after another, the children walk to him and embrace him --"
4352,4352,"Nathan, Samuel, Margaret, William."
4353,4353,"He sees Susan, standing next to Charlotte.  He motions to"
4354,4354,her but she doesn't move.  Then he kneels down and gently
4355,4355,hugs her.
4356,4356,"				MARION"
4357,4357,"		Just a little goodbye?  One word?"
4358,4358,"		That's all I want to hear."
4359,4359,"Susan remains silent, standing with her arms at her sides,"
4360,4360,not responding to the embrace.
4361,4361,"Finally, Marion lets go of her.  She just stares at him."
4362,4362,Marion stands and turns to Charlotte.
4363,4363,"				MARION"
4364,4364,"		Goodbye, Charlotte."
4365,4365,"				CHARLOTTE"
4366,4366,"		Goodbye."
4367,4367,"They embrace.  Though the hug is chaste, their eyes tell a"
4368,4368,"different story.  Only Anne and Margaret notice, but to"
4369,4369,them it's as clear as a bell.  They exchange a knowing
4370,4370,look.
4371,4371,"Marion and Charlotte break apart, self-consciously."
4372,4372,Marion and Gabriel mount up and start to ride away.  As
4373,4373,"they're about to round a curve and disappear, SUSAN CRIES"
4374,4374,OUT:
4375,4375,"				SUSAN"
4376,4376,"		Papa!"
4377,4377,"With halting steps, then faster and faster, she runs down"
4378,4378,the path toward Marion.
4379,4379,"				SUSAN"
4380,4380,"		Papa, don't go, I'll say anything."
4381,4381,"Marion stops, turning in his saddle to see Susan running"
4382,4382,"after him, her eyes filled with tears."
4383,4383,"				SUSAN"
4384,4384,"		Please, Papa, I'll say anything you"
4385,4385,"		want!"
4386,4386,"Marion yanks his reins, turning his horse."
4387,4387,"				SUSAN"
4388,4388,"		Just tell me what to say!  Tell me"
4389,4389,"		what to say!"
4390,4390,"Marion spurs his horse straight toward her, GALLOPING"
4391,4391,"toward the running, crying child."
4392,4392,"				SUSAN"
4393,4393,"		Please, Papa, please don't go."
4394,4394,MARION RIDES TOWARD HER...
4395,4395,"Charlotte, Anne and Marion's children watch as:"
4396,4396,MARION LEANS OVER IN THE SADDLE without slowing down...
4397,4397,SWOOPING HER 
4398,4398, HIS LAP...
4399,4399,"She sits astride the saddle, facing him, her arms wrapped"
4400,4400,"around him, pleading, the words tumbling from her, as fast"
4401,4401,as she can get them out...
4402,4402,"				SUSAN"
4403,4403,"		... I'll talk to you, I'll say"
4404,4404,"		anything you want, just tell me what"
4405,4405,"		you want me to say, I'll say"
4406,4406,"		anything, I promise, please, Papa,"
4407,4407,"		just stay..."
4408,4408,"Marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl, holding her,"
4409,4409,"letting her cry, fighting his own tears..."
4410,4410,"He reins back the horse, stopping in front of the"
4411,4411,others...
4412,4412,He pleadingly looks to Charlotte who steps up to the
4413,4413,horse... to take Susan...
4414,4414,"Marion gives Susan a final embrace, and covers her face"
4415,4415,with kisses...
4416,4416,"				MARION"
4417,4417,"		I'll come back... I promise..."
4418,4418,Marion hands the still crying Susan down to Charlotte...
4419,4419,"Marion, in agony, averts his eyes, yanks his reins, and"
4420,4420,spurs his horse...
4421,4421,"As he rides away the children take off after him, running."
4422,4422,"Susan seeing the others running after Marion, struggles"
4423,4423,"out of Charlotte's arms, and runs after them as well..."
4424,4424,"Marion rides, now joined by Gabriel, faster and faster,"
4425,4425,leaving a trail of dust...
4426,4426,"The children slow, then stop, one after another, watching"
4427,4427,as they ride away.
4428,4428,
4429,4429,  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - ACWORTH - EVENING
4430,4430,Grim.  The most rudimentary of the encampments we've seen.
4431,4431,Rain pours.  Some of Marion's men huddle under lean-to's
4432,4432,and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial
4433,4433,protection from the cold rain.
4434,4434,Abner and Scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire
4435,4435,going.  Rev. Oliver tries to cook.
4436,4436,Marion and Gabriel ride up and dismount.  Marion joins
4437,4437,Rev. Oliver.
4438,4438,"				MARION"
4439,4439,"		How many came back?"
4440,4440,"				REV. OLIVER"
4441,4441,"		About a hundred and twenty.  Less"
4442,4442,"		than a third."
4443,4443,Marion nods.  He and Gabriel join some of the men under
4444,4444,one of the lean-to's.
4445,4445,
4446,4446,  RIVERSIDE - DAY
4447,4447,The rain has stopped.  The ground is still wet.  It's
4448,4448,spring.  The first buds are on the maple trees.  A fox
4449,4449,"tentatively comes out of its winter den, followed by a"
4450,4450,pair of pups.
4451,4451,"Marion stands on the side of a river, looking up at a"
4452,4452,chevron of Canadian geese flying north.
4453,4453,
4454,4454,  PEMBROKE - DAY
4455,4455,The Canadian Geese fly over Anne who is behind her
4456,4456,"father's store, tying food and provisions to a couple of"
4457,4457,packhorses.  A mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock.
4458,4458,Suddenly Anne senses someone behind her and turns to see
4459,4459,HALF-A DOZEN REDCOATS.  She's initially frightened but the
4460,4460,"REDCOAT SERGEANT, speaks politely."
4461,4461,"				REDCOAT SERGEANT"
4462,4462,"		Excuse me, Ma'am, everyone has been"
4463,4463,"		requested to gather at the church."
4464,4464,"				ANNE"
4465,4465,"		Everyone?"
4466,4466,"				REDCOAT SERGEANT"
4467,4467,"		Colonel Tarleton wants to address,"
4468,4468,"		the whole village."
4469,4469,The Redcoat Sergeant deferentially motions for Anne to
4470,4470,follow him and his men.  She sees several other
4471,4471,"townspeople, with Redcoat escorts, already heading down"
4472,4472,the street.  She follows along.
4473,4473,
4474,4474,  PEMBROKE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY
4475,4475,"Tarleton and Wilkins, on horseback, watch as a large,"
4476,4476,mixed detachment of Green Dragoons and Redcoat Infantry
4477,4477,directs the villagers into the church.
4478,4478,One of the Redcoats walks out of the general store with a
4479,4479,bowl of gumdrops.  As he starts giving them to a few of
4480,4480,"the children their parents waver, unsure of the gesture,"
4481,4481,but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy.
4482,4482,The townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of
4483,4483,"the Redcoats who, though carry muskets, are polite and"
4484,4484,unthreatening.
4485,4485,"				REDCOAT"
4486,4486,"		Into the church, please."
4487,4487,"				ANOTHER REDCOAT"
4488,4488,"		Colonel Tarleton wishes to address"
4489,4489,"		all of you."
4490,4490,Tarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the
4491,4491,church.  He nods to the Redcoats near the door.
4492,4492,"The Redcoats CLOSE THE DOORS, chaining them shut.  The"
4493,4493,DOOR IS POUNDED ON from the inside.
4494,4494,"				VOICE"
4495,4495,"		Open this door!"
4496,4496,"				ANOTHER VOICE"
4497,4497,"		By what right are we made prisoners?"
4498,4498,"TARLETON NODS TO GASKINS who, along with several rough-"
4499,4499,"looking LOYALIST MILITIAMEN, disappear into the blacksmith"
4500,4500,shop.  They reappear a moment later with FLAMING TORCHES
4501,4501,and approach the church.
4502,4502,Several Redcoats see what's about to happen and are
4503,4503,"appalled.  Even some of the Green Dragoons, including"
4504,4504,"Wilkins, are troubled.  Wilkins rides over to Tarleton."
4505,4505,"				WILKINS"
4506,4506,"		Sir?"
4507,4507,"				TARLETON"
4508,4508,"		Yes, Major."
4509,4509,"Gaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church,"
4510,4510,"torches ready, waiting for the final go-ahead from"
4511,4511,Tarleton.  The POUNDING AND CALLING from inside the church
4512,4512,grows louder.
4513,4513,"				WILKINS"
4514,4514,"		Sir, there is no honor in this."
4515,4515,"				TARLETON"
4516,4516,"		The honor is found in the end, not"
4517,4517,"		the means.  This will be forgotten."
4518,4518,"			   (to Gaskins)"
4519,4519,"		Proceed."
4520,4520,The Redcoats turn to the Redcoat Officers.  The Redcoat
4521,4521,"officers turn to Wilkins, who struggles with himself."
4522,4522,Tarleton calmly watches Wilkins' distress.
4523,4523,"Finally, Wilkins accepts it.  Weakly steadying his horse,"
4524,4524,he takes his place next to Tarleton.
4525,4525,The Redcoats and Dragoons follow his lead and watch as
4526,4526,Gaskins and the Loyalist Militiamen light the church on
4527,4527,"fire, heaving their torches onto the roof, through the"
4528,4528,windows and under the raised foundation.
4529,4529,SCREAMS are heard from inside.  The DOOR THUDS with the
4530,4530,shoulders of men trying to escape.  The CHAINS HOLD.
4531,4531,"As the FLAMES RISE, another group of Loyalist Militiamen"
4532,4532,and some Redcoats drag half-a-dozen young women out of a
4533,4533,side-street...
4534,4534,"Among the women, desperately pleading, kicking and"
4535,4535,"screaming, is ANNE..."
4536,4536,The men drag her and the other women into the livery
4537,4537,stable...
4538,4538,"Tarleton watches them carried off, stone-faced..."
4539,4539,Then he turns and watches the church go up in FLAMES...
4540,4540,"A WINDOW SHATTERS, with a chair heaved from inside..."
4541,4541,"SOME MEN TRY TO CLIMB OUT, but waiting Redcoats FIRE THEIR"
4542,4542,MUSKETS PO
4543,4543,BLANK...
4544,4544,"KILLING THREE MEN, driving the others back..."
4545,4545,The SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE CHURCH grow louder...
4546,4546,The FLAMES AND SMOKE RISE...
4547,4547,
4548,4548,  WOODS - PEMBROKE OUTSKIRTS - DAY
4549,4549,SILENCE.  A dark forest of old growth trees.  No
4550,4550,"underbrush.  Marion and a couple dozen of his men,"
4551,4551,"including Gabriel, Rev. Oliver, and Dalton ride warily on"
4552,4552,"a carpet of pine needles toward a thin column of smoke,"
4553,4553,visible over the treetops in the distance.
4554,4554,"With hand signals, Marion directs his men to fan out."
4555,4555,"They do so, weaving through the dark forest, weapons"
4556,4556,ready.
4557,4557,
4558,4558,  PEMBROKE - DAY
4559,4559,Marion and his men slowly ride into Pembroke.  The remains
4560,4560,of the church smolder only slightly.  The town is
4561,4561,"deserted, no one, dead or alive, is visible."
4562,4562,"Unsure what they have found, Marion and his men spread out"
4563,4563,"and dismount, warily checking out the buildings, looking"
4564,4564,for some sign of life.
4565,4565,Rev. Oliver and a few other men head for the charred
4566,4566,remains of the church.
4567,4567,"Side-stepping some still-hot, charred beams, Rev. Oliver"
4568,4568,looks through the rubble...
4569,4569,Then he sees the bodies...
4570,4570,THE CAMERA CATCHES ONLY A FLEETING GLIMPSE of...
4571,4571,"Dozens of charred, blackened bodies, intertwined with the"
4572,4572,remains of the church...
4573,4573,Rev. Oliver staggers from the rubble...
4574,4574,The other men see what he has seen...
4575,4575,One-by-one Marion and his men walk over and look into the
4576,4576,remains of the church...
4577,4577,Marion see several charred hands extended through a
4578,4578,"shattered window, as if grasping for escape... one of the"
4579,4579,"hands is tiny, A CHILD'S HAND..."
4580,4580,Marion is stunned...
4581,4581,No one says a word...
4582,4582,"Dalton and a few of the other men continue the search,"
4583,4583,weapons ready...
4584,4584,"They step into the livery stable, then walk out a moment"
4585,4585,"later, ashen faced..."
4586,4586,"Dalton speaks quietly to Marion, motioning toward an"
4587,4587,increasingly frantic Gabriel who has just found Anne's
4588,4588,packhorses...
4589,4589,"Gabriel notices the gesture, he watches Marion walk into"
4590,4590,"the livery stable... Growing more nervous by the second,"
4591,4591,Gabriel hurries after his father...
4592,4592,"				GABRIEL"
4593,4593,"		Anne...?"
4594,4594,"As Gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable,"
4595,4595,Marion walks out and intercepts him.
4596,4596,"				MARION"
4597,4597,"		Don't go in there."
4598,4598,"				GABRIEL"
4599,4599,"		Is it her?  Is Anne in there?"
4600,4600,"				MARION"
4601,4601,"		She is.  Don't go in there."
4602,4602,Gabriel understands... he reels... growing faint... Marion
4603,4603,grabs him... keeping him from falling...
4604,4604,Marion holds Gabriel who begins to weep...
4605,4605,
4606,4606,  PEMBROKE - DAY
4607,4607,"Marion's men, led by Rev. Oliver, tend to the dead.  Some"
4608,4608,dig in the small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the
4609,4609,church.  Others carry out the grim task of pulling the
4610,4610,charred bodies out of the rubble.
4611,4611,ON THE EDGE OF TOWN
4612,4612,Marion sits alone.  Gabriel walks up behind him.
4613,4613,"				GABRIEL"
4614,4614,"		Father, tell me what happened at"
4615,4615,"		Fort Wilderness?"
4616,4616,"				MARION"
4617,4617,"		You know what happened."
4618,4618,"				GABRIEL"
4619,4619,"		No, I don't."
4620,4620,"				MARION"
4621,4621,"		Everyone knows.  It's what made me a"
4622,4622,"		hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I"
4623,4623,"		got a medal.  Men bought me drinks."
4624,4624,"		They still do sometimes.  Everyone"
4625,4625,"		knows what happened."
4626,4626,"				GABRIEL"
4627,4627,"		Tell me what everyone doesn't know."
4628,4628,"				MARION"
4629,4629,"		And what do they know?"
4630,4630,"				GABRIEL"
4631,4631,"		That the French and Cherokees"
4632,4632,"		captured the fort and when you"
4633,4633,"		retook it, you took revenge on them"
4634,4634,"		for what they did during the"
4635,4635,"		occupation."
4636,4636,"				MARION"
4637,4637,"		That's right."
4638,4638,"				GABRIEL"
4639,4639,"		That's not enough.  Tell me."
4640,4640,"				MARION"
4641,4641,"		Your mother asked me the same"
4642,4642,"		question around the time you were"
4643,4643,"		born.  I was drunk and I was foolish"
4644,4644,"		enough to answer her."
4645,4645,Marion shakes his head to himself.
4646,4646,"				MARION"
4647,4647,"		That's why it was four years between"
4648,4648,"		you and Thomas.  It took me that"
4649,4649,"		long to regain her respect."
4650,4650,"				GABRIEL"
4651,4651,"		I'm not my mother.  I can't have the"
4652,4652,"		respect without the knowing."
4653,4653,Marion's quiet for a moment.  Then he speaks:
4654,4654,"				MARION"
4655,4655,"		It was in '63.  It was a bad time."
4656,4656,"		The French and the Cherokee had"
4657,4657,"		raided along the Blue Ridge.  All"
4658,4658,"		the English settlers took refuge at"
4659,4659,"		Fort Wilderness but the French"
4660,4660,"		captured it.  We were sent in"
4661,4661,"		relief.  Harry Lee, Billings, sixty"
4662,4662,"		of us.  We already had something of"
4663,4663,"		a reputation for being... harsh."
4664,4664,"		When we got there the fort was"
4665,4665,"		abandoned.  Not a French soldier or"
4666,4666,"		Cherokee anywhere.  They had left a"
4667,4667,"		week earlier.  What we found was..."
4668,4668,"		bad."
4669,4669,Marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad.
4670,4670,"				MARION"
4671,4671,"		They had left the settlers there."
4672,4672,"		The men had been burned alive, the"
4673,4673,"		women were in pieces and the"
4674,4674,"		children were on stakes."
4675,4675,Marion's silent for a moment.
4676,4676,"				MARION"
4677,4677,"		We buried them, then we went to"
4678,4678,"		track.  It was a cold trail and they"
4679,4679,"		were moving fast.  We went faster."
4680,4680,"		We caught up to them at Kentucky"
4681,4681,"		Ford."
4682,4682,"				GABRIEL"
4683,4683,"		Go on."
4684,4684,"				MARION"
4685,4685,"		We took our time with them and gave"
4686,4686,"		every one of them worse than they"
4687,4687,"		had given at the fort.  It was two"
4688,4688,"		weeks before they were all dead, all"
4689,4689,"		except two.  We put the heads on a"
4690,4690,"		pallet and had the two we let live"

4698,4698,"		The French stayed east of the Blue"

4701,4701,"		and stayed out of the fight."
4702,4702,"			   (beat)"
4703,4703,"		That seemed to make a difference."
4704,4704,"		The war went another year, things"
4705,4705,"		went better... and men bought us"
4706,4706,"		drinks."
4707,4707,Gabriel is silent.  Marion looks at him closely.
4708,4708,"				MARION"
4709,4709,"		It was a different time, son.  And"
4710,4710,"		you're a better man than that."
4711,4711,"				GABRIEL"
4712,4712,"		I see, do as I say, not as I do."
4713,4713,"				MARION"
4714,4714,"		Yes."
4715,4715,They hear HORSES HOOVES.  Abner rides in from the opposite
4716,4716,"side of the village from the church, not having seen the"
4717,4717,"results of the massacre.  Excited, he dismounts."
4718,4718,"				ABNER"
4719,4719,"		THEY'RE HERE!  CONTINENTALS, THEY'RE"
4720,4720,"		HERE!"
4721,4721,Marion and Gabriel just look at him.  Abner is confused by
4722,4722,their reaction.  Then he sees the remains of the church
4723,4723,"and the laid out, charred bodies."
4724,4724,
4725,4725,  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
4726,4726,Mixed gatherings of Marion's militia and Continentals are
4727,4727,"clustered around the campfires, with more Continentals"
4728,4728,arriving all the time.
4729,4729,Some of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with
4730,4730,"tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired,"
4731,4731,talking quietly.
4732,4732,A couple of Patriots play a MELANCHOLY TUNE ON FIFE AND
4733,4733,VIOLIN.
4734,4734,Marion's tent is set up but he's nowhere to be seen.
4735,4735,Gabriel walks to Marion's gear.  Finding Marion's weapon's
4736,4736,belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the
4737,4737,paint-flecked MUSKET BALLS MADE FROM THOMAS' LEAD
4738,4738,"SOLDIERS.  As Gabriel takes one, Marion steps up behind"
4739,4739,him.
4740,4740,"				MARION"
4741,4741,"		If this war is about more than"
4742,4742,"		Thomas, it's about more than Anne,"
4743,4743,"		as well.  Stay the course."
4744,4744,"				GABRIEL"
4745,4745,"		As you did at Fort Wilderness?"
4746,4746,Before Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TO
4747,4747,"THEM.  He dismounts, excited, voluble.  He strides over,"
4748,4748,"pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel's"
4749,4749,mood.
4750,4750,"				LEE"
4751,4751,"		Look at you!  I knew you could do"
4752,4752,"		it!"
4753,4753,"Lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull."
4754,4754,"				LEE"
4755,4755,"		We have a chance!  Better than a"
4756,4756,"		chance!  Cornwallis is running to"
4757,4757,"		the Chesapeake, probably to meet his"
4758,4758,"		fleet at Yorktown.  I wish I could"
4759,4759,"		see his face when he sees a dozen"
4760,4760,"		French ships floating there.  And"
4761,4761,"		Washington should be a day or two"
4762,4762,"		behind him."
4763,4763,"			   (beat)"
4764,4764,"		And on top of everything, I have a"
4765,4765,"		son!  Born last month in Alexandria."
4766,4766,Gabriel rises and walks away.  Lee finally tunes into the
4767,4767,pall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel.
4768,4768,He turns to Marion.
4769,4769,"				MARION"
4770,4770,"		His wife was killed yesterday.  She"
4771,4771,"		was with child."
4772,4772,"				LEE"
4773,4773,"		I'm sorry, I didn't know."
4774,4774,Marion nods.  They stand in silence.  Lee hands Marion the
4775,4775,bottle.  He takes a drink.
4776,4776,
4777,4777,  ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
4778,4778,Dark.  Quiet.  Sentries are on duty.  Marion's tent glows
4779,4779,"from a single candle.  He blows the candle out, then steps"
4780,4780,out of the tent into the night.
4781,4781,He begins his nightly walk of the perimeter.
4782,4782,"Almost immediately, Marion notices something amiss."
4783,4783,Dalton has discovered it at the same time and hurries over
4784,4784,to Marion.
4785,4785,AT ONE OF THE CAMPSITES
4786,4786,Marion and Dalton and several of the other men look down
4787,4787,at some empty bedrolls.
4788,4788,"				DALTON"
4789,4789,"		Gabriel and at least a dozen others."
4790,4790,"		They must have left right after the"

4792,4792,"				MARION"
4793,4793,"		That means they have two hours on"
4794,4794,"		us."
4795,4795,Marion strides to his horse.  The other men follow him.
4796,4796,

4802,4802,"Dark.  Very quiet.  A moonless night.  Marion and his men,"
4803,4803,"on foot, make their way along the side of the river."
4804,4804,Brother Joseph hurries out of the darkness and speaks to
4805,4805,Marion.
4806,4806,"				BROTHER JOSEPH"
4807,4807,"		Fifty Green Dragoons, camped about a"

4810,4810,Suddenly they hear the SOUNDS OF MUSKETS FIRE ahead of
4811,4811,them in the darkness.  Marion takes off at a full run with
4812,4812,his men right behind.
4813,4813,
4814,4814,  OUTSKIRTS OF GREEN DRAGOON ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
4815,4815,Marion and his men BLAST THROUGH THE BRUSH.  Running
4816,4816,"toward the SOUNDS OF THE BATTLE, which grows louder with"
4817,4817,every step...
4818,4818,Marion cocks his pistol and extracts his tomahawk on the
4819,4819,run...
4820,4820,The LIGHTS OF THE BATTLE:  The STROBES OF THE MUSKET SHOTS

4822,4822,"Moving fast, they PASS TWO DEAD BRITISH SENTRIES, without"

4824,4824,THEY BLAST OUT OF THE WOODS into...
4825,4825,"THE CLEARING, seeing a tableau of TOTAL CHAOS:"
4826,4826,Half-dressed GREEN DRAGOONS in formation FIRE IN

4828,4828,Running men.  Scattered MUSKET FIRE.
4829,4829,The strobes of the muskets illuminate RUNNING MEN and
4830,4830,other men in HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.
4831,4831,WILKINS IS IN COMMAND.  Tarleton is nowhere to be seen.
4832,4832,"Gabriel and Abner, both slightly wounded, fight a"
4833,4833,desperate holding action...
4834,4834,"On the other side of the clearing, a square of Dragoons"

4836,4836,"				WILKINS"
4837,4837,"		FIRE!"
4838,4838,"The DRAGOONS FIRE A MASSED VOLLEY, hitting Gabriel, Abner"
4839,4839,and several other Patriots.
4840,4840,"GABRIEL, BADLY WOUNDED, falls to his knees..."
4841,4841,The Dragoons pull their pistols about to fire again.
4842,4842,Marion and his men OPEN FIRE...
4843,4843,Staggering them...
4844,4844,Marion sees Wilkins about to fire at Gabriel...
4845,4845,Marion runs...
4846,4846,Sees another Redcoat about to fire at Gabriel...
4847,4847,MARION KILLS HIM with a pistol shot.
4848,4848,"Wilkins cocks his flintlock pistol, aims at Gabriel..."
4849,4849,MARION'S ABOUT TO THROW HIS TOMAHAWK... TOO LATE...
4850,4850,WILKINS FIRES... HITTING GABRIEL WHO FLIES BACKWARD...

4856,4856,Throws himself onto the ground next to him...
4857,4857,Cradling him...

4864,4864,Gabriel weakens in Marion's arms... falters... Marion
4865,4865,watches the life drain from Gabriel... He tries to hold
4866,4866,"the blood in, to no avail..."
4867,4867,"Dalton plants himself next to Marion, defending him and"
4868,4868,Gabriel...
4869,4869,Marion caresses Gabriel and watches as...
4870,4870,GABRIEL DIES.
4871,4871,The life drains from Marion.  No anger.  Only pain.  He
4872,4872,"looks at Gabriel, lost in a dream, an incomprehensible"
4873,4873,nightmare of loss and overwhelming emptiness.
4874,4874,
4875,4875,  CLEARING - DAWN
4876,4876,Marion's men finish laying out the bodies of their dead.
4877,4877,The Dragoons are still where they fell.  The Patriots are
4878,4878,"laid out in a row, their faces covered by their coats."
4879,4879,"Marion sits on the battlefield, next to Gabriel's body."
4880,4880,Dalton gingerly approaches him.

4882,4882,"		Colonel..."
4883,4883,"Marion slowly stands and picks up Gabriel's body, cradling"

4887,4887,"More Continentals have arrived, now outnumbering Marion's"
4888,4888,men three-to-one.  The encampment is active.  A few of the
4889,4889,men drink and TALK LOUDLY.  The two men playing the fife
4890,4890,and violin PLAY A MORE VIBRANT TUNE.
4891,4891,
4892,4892,  MARION'S TENT - NIGHT
4893,4893,Dark.  Shadowed.  The sounds of celebration can be heard
4894,4894,outside the tent.
4895,4895,Marion sits on his camp chair.  Gabriel lies on the ground
4896,4896,carefully covered up to his chin with a blanket.  A single
4897,4897,candle burns.
4898,4898,Rev. Oliver enters the tent.
4899,4899,"				REV. OLIVER"
4900,4900,"		May I help you try to find solace"

4910,4910,"		Yes, he does."
4911,4911,Rev. Oliver pulls up a camp stool.  He and Marion sit in
4912,4912,silence.
4913,4913,

4915,4915,"The Patriots, Continentals and Militia, are moving out."
4916,4916,Most of the tents have been taken down.  Wagons are
4917,4917,rolling out.  Companies of Continentals march off in good
4918,4918,order.
4919,4919,"MARION'S TENT still stands.  His men finish packing up,"
4920,4920,"storing their heavy gear in wagons, tying their field gear"
4921,4921,onto their horses.
4922,4922,IN THE TENT
4923,4923,Marion still sits.  A FLY BUZZES.  Gabriel's face has
4924,4924,"taken on a deathly, ashen look."
4925,4925,"Lee enters the tent.  He's silent for a moment, then"
4926,4926,speaks softly to Marion.
4927,4927,"				LEE"
4928,4928,"		You have to bury him."

4957,4957,he hears the SOUND OF THE DEPARTING TROOPS OUTSIDE THE
4958,4958,TENT.
4959,4959,"He looks at Marion, touches him on the shoulder and walks"
4960,4960,out.

4962,4962,  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - DAY
4963,4963,"The last of the soldiers move out, leaving their"

4968,4968,"Marion sits in his tent, gazing obliquely at Gabriel's"
4969,4969,body which has grown even more ashen.  A SOLITARY BIRD

4971,4971,
4972,4972,  WOODED ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
4973,4973,"A dark, moonless night.  The sky is filled with stars.  A"
4974,4974,SOFT WIND BLOWS dead leaves along the ground.  A few of
4975,4975,the leaves are blown through the opening of Marion's tent.
4976,4976,INSIDE THE TENT
4977,4977,"Marion looks down, noticing the leaves, HEARING THE WIND."
4978,4978,He listens for a moment.  Then he stands and walks out of
4979,4979,the tent.
4980,4980,OUTSIDE THE TENT
4981,4981,Marion watches the leaves skittering along the ground.  He
4982,4982,listens to the wind.
4983,4983,The HE LOOKS UP AT THE NIGHT SKY.  The stars are bright.
4984,4984,His eyes are drawn to the Big Dipper and from there to the
4985,4985,Little Dipper and the...
4986,4986,NORTH STAR.
4987,4987,"Holding his eyes on the faint, but steady star, he"
4988,4988,gradually reorients himself.  He looks around at the
4989,4989,abandoned encampment.  Then he looks into the tent and
4990,4990,sees Gabriel's body.  The SOFT WIND BLOWS AROUND HIM.

5015,5015,"stopped to look out at the view.  Marion, Lee, Rev. Oliver"
5016,5016,and Dalton join them.
5017,5017,The French Fleet is visible in the harbor.  The British
5018,5018,"encampments are on a pair of peninsulas, one jutting out"
5019,5019,"from land, the other jutting toward the land from a large"
5020,5020,"island.  In a semi-circle around the landward peninsula,"
5021,5021,the beginnings of the Patriot encirclement are visible.
5022,5022,It's a grand and impressive sight.
5023,5023,Marion and the others turn their horses and head down the

5032,5032,"MARION, stands behind a barricade, trying to get a view of"

5035,5035,"				RUNNER"
5036,5036,"		You called for me, sir?"
5037,5037,Marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single
5038,5038,WALNUT which he hands to the boy.
5039,5039,"				MARION"
5040,5040,"		Take this to General Washington."
5041,5041,The boy looks at the walnut and then looks at Marion as if
5042,5042,he's joking or crazy.  He's neither.  The boy shrugs and
5043,5043,runs off with the walnut.
5044,5044,
5045,5045,  WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN

5070,5070,  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - DAY
5071,5071,CAMERA FOLLOWS Marion walking through the chaos of the
5072,5072,encampment.  He walks to the cluster of tents around
5073,5073,Washington's HQ.  He nods to the officer in charge.
5074,5074,"				MARION"
5075,5075,"		Colonel Francis Marion."
5076,5076,"Washington, leaning over the maps on his campaign table,"
5077,5077,hears the voice and turns around.  The officers nearby
5078,5078,"stop and watch, curious."
5079,5079,MARION AND WASHINGTON
5080,5080,"Step up to one another, looking each other in the eye."
5081,5081,"To the astonishment of Washington's officers, Marion"
5082,5082,"reaches up and lifts off Washington's wig, looking at his"
5083,5083,hair underneath.  Marion shakes his head.
5084,5084,"				MARION"
5085,5085,"		Gray."
5086,5086,"				WASHINGTON"
5087,5087,"		Earned."
5088,5088,Washington holds out a small bag to Marion who reaches in
5089,5089,and pulls out a walnut.
5090,5090,"				WASHINGTON"
5091,5091,"		Come.  I have something I want to"
5092,5092,"		show you."
5093,5093,Washington turns to his staff officers.
5094,5094,"				WASHINGTON"
5095,5095,"		Gentlemen."
5096,5096,Washington and Marion walk off with Washington's officers
5097,5097,"and aides.As Washington and Marion walk, they both CRUSH"
5098,5098,"THE WALNUTS SHELLS BETWEEN THEIR THUMBS AND FOREFINGERS, a"
5099,5099,prodigious display of strength that both men take for
5100,5100,granted.  They eat walnuts as they walk.

5102,5102,  YORKTOWN HILLTOP - DAY
5103,5103,"Washington's officers who include HARRY LEE, COLONEL"
5104,5104,"ALEXANDER HAMILTON, LAFAYETTE, GENERAL PINKNEY, and"
5105,5105,various other aides and junior officers reach the crest of
5106,5106,the hill and wait for Washington and Marion who trail a
5107,5107,"bit behind them, talking privately, eating walnuts as they"
5108,5108,go.
5109,5109,"While they wait, the officers look out at the view, seeing"
5110,5110,the PUFFS OF SMOKE OF 
5111,5111,RMITTENT CANNON FIRE.
5112,5112,WASHINGTON AND MARION
5113,5113,Finish the walnuts.  They stop for a moment to catch their
5114,5114,breath.
5115,5115,"				WASHINGTON"
5116,5116,"		I was sorry to hear about your son."
5117,5117,"				MARION"
5118,5118,"		I lost another a year ago, Thomas."
5119,5119,"		He was only fifteen."

5123,5123,"			   (beat)"
5124,5124,"		I lose the sons of other men."
5125,5125,"They look out at the vista, knowing that they're looking"
5126,5126,at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men.
5127,5127,"				WASHINGTON"
5128,5128,"		Life was easier when we only had"
5129,5129,"		ourselves to get killed."
5130,5130,"They walk on, joining the others on the crest of the hill."
5131,5131,"The officers are looking out, some with spyglasses, at"
5132,5132,the British emplacements.
5133,5133,"				WASHINGTON"
5134,5134,"		Gentlemen, what do we see?"

5140,5140,"		behind the forward redoubts."
5141,5141,"				LAFAYETTE"
5142,5142,"		A formidable defensive position."
5143,5143,"		Very formidable."
5144,5144,"				HAMILTON"
5145,5145,"		They could hold out for weeks."
5146,5146,Washington nods and turns to Marion.
5147,5147,"				WASHINGTON"
5148,5148,"		Francis, tell me about General"
5149,5149,"		Cornwallis."
5150,5150,"				MARION"

5152,5152,"				WASHINGTON"
5153,5153,"		That bad?"
5154,5154,"				MARION"
5155,5155,"		Worse."
5156,5156,"				WASHINGTON"
5157,5157,"		Proud, priggish and competent.  A"
5158,5158,"		very bad combination in an"
5159,5159,"		adversary."
5160,5160,Washington sighs.
5161,5161,"				WASHINGTON"
5162,5162,"		For those of you who don't know, we"
5163,5163,"		intercepted a British dispatch this"
5164,5164,"		morning.  General Clinton has sailed"
5165,5165,"		from New York to relieve Cornwallis."
5166,5166,That hits Washington's officers hard.
5167,5167,"				HAMILTON"
5168,5168,"		How long before they arrive?"
5169,5169,"				WASHINGTON"
5170,5170,"		Less than a week.  Sixteen ships and"

5173,5173,"		Sooner or later that message will"
5174,5174,"		get through to Cornwallis."
5175,5175,"				PINKNEY"
5176,5176,"		And when it does, he'll just wait us"
5177,5177,"		out."
5178,5178,"				WASHINGTON"
5179,5179,"		And when the British ships arrive,"
5180,5180,"		the French ships will flee.  And"
5181,5181,"		when the French ships flee, General"
5182,5182,"		Rochambeau and the French troops"
5183,5183,"		will flee as well."
5184,5184,Marion speaks up.
5185,5185,"				MARION"
5186,5186,"		Then you must let the message go"
5187,5187,"		through."
5188,5188,"They all turn to Marion, most of them looking at him as if"
5189,5189,he's insane.
5190,5190,"				WASHINGTON"
5191,5191,"		If Cornwallis receives news that"
5192,5192,"		Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold"
5193,5193,"		tight and wait.  He'll fight a"
5194,5194,"		purely defensive battle and he'll"
5195,5195,"		win that."
5196,5196,"				MARION"
5197,5197,"		No, he won't.  There are two things"
5198,5198,"		you need to know about Cornwallis."
5199,5199,"		First, he is a very proud man, He"
5200,5200,"		would rather risk defeat than share"
5201,5201,"		a victory."
5202,5202,"			   (beat)"

5205,5205,"				WASHINGTON"
5206,5206,"		And what is the second thing?"
5207,5207,Marion pulls Cornwallis' journal out of his haversack and
5208,5208,leafs through it.
5209,5209,"				MARION"
5210,5210,"		I'll let him tell you himself..."

5212,5212,"		\""... but it is this colonial militia"
5213,5213,"		that is the most irksome.  Not"

5217,5217,"		of a soldier's honor, but sullying"

5233,5233,"		Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton"
5234,5234,"		made it through the rebel lines."
5235,5235,Cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it.  It staggers

5237,5237,"				WILKINS"
5238,5238,"		Sir?"
5239,5239,Cornwallis fumes.  His jaw sets with anger.  He slowly
5240,5240,crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury.
5241,5241,"				CORNWALLIS"
5242,5242,"		Call a general staff meeting."

5246,5246,  YORKTOWN - PRE-DAWN
5247,5247,"Marion stands at the American battlements, looking out at"
5248,5248,"the British defensive works.  Above him, stars are"
5249,5249,"visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre-dawn"
5250,5250,glow from the horizon.
5251,5251,"Marion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the"
5252,5252,"NORTH STAR, but in the increasingly harsh light of this"

5256,5256,  YORKTOWN BATTLEFIELD - DAY
5257,5257,The sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility
5258,5258,to a few dozen yards.  Men move like ghosts.
5259,5259,THE CAMERA finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist.
5260,5260,"There is no overview, just separate detachments:"
5261,5261,"An orderly regiment of CONTINENTAL CAVALRY, mounted,"
5262,5262,"waiting, steadying their horses."
5263,5263,Two long lines of CONTINENTAL INFANTRY RESERVES...
5264,5264,"An American Command, including Washington, LaFayette and"
5265,5265,"two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and"
5266,5266,runners...
5267,5267,"And, finally, MARION AND HIS MEN, who stand in the middle"
5268,5268,"of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long,"
5269,5269,valley-line depression.
5270,5270,"They stand silently, unable to see anything other than"
5271,5271,each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass
5272,5272,in front of them.
5273,5273,They're all grim.  They know what's coming.
5274,5274,"Then, the SOUND OF A SINGLE DRUM, heard but unseen, coming"
5275,5275,from over the slope...
5276,5276,"Then, MORE DRUMS, more and more, A COMPETITION OF DRUM"
5277,5277,BEATS...
5278,5278,"Marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to"
5279,5279,imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in

5281,5281,"MARION MOTIONS FOR HIS OFFICERS, Dalton, Scott, Rev."
5282,5282,Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from

5285,5285,"		The British army believes in"

5290,5290,They listen closely.
5291,5291,"				MARION"
5292,5292,"		We are the bait in a trap.  We're"

5294,5294,"		rabble, nothing more than a bunch of"
5295,5295,"		undisciplined farmers.  And if he"
5296,5296,"		thinks that's what we are, that's"
5297,5297,"		what we're going to give him."

5302,5302,"Cornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, including"
5303,5303,"Tarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of a"
5304,5304,spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the
5305,5305,morning mist begins to burn off.
5306,5306,"Through the fog, he just makes out the American lines.  He"

5315,5315,  LOW MEADOW - YORKTOWN - MORNING
5316,5316,Marion and his men wait.
5317,5317,"A STRANGE SOUND.  Soft, muted.  The men turn their heads,"
5318,5318,"listening, their eyes shifting."
5319,5319,"They hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS,"
5320,5320,advancing...
5321,5321,THE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as they
5322,5322,listen to an unseen army approaching.
5323,5323,ON MARION'S FACE we see him hearing every sound and we see
5324,5324,FLASH CUTS of what he knows he's hearing:
5325,5325,The BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS...
5326,5326,Shouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles...
5327,5327,SILENCE at a stop...
5328,5328,MORE DRUMS...
5329,5329,The men around Marion wait.
5330,5330,"THEN, THEY SEE IT..."
5331,5331,A MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of
5332,5332,them...
5333,5333,"Thousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in"
5334,5334,"lockstep, straight for them."
5335,5335,"Marion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them"
5336,5336,move...
5337,5337,The BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER... it's almost
5338,5338,enough to drive a man to flight... almost.
5339,5339,"The CAMERA explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that"
5340,5340,"we know, Rev. Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion.  All are"
5341,5341,frightened but all are motionless.
5342,5342,"Closer and closer, the British line approaches..."
5343,5343,The American's don't move...
5344,5344,"Then, the BRITISH LINE STOPS..."
5345,5345,"At a flurry of commands, the Redcoats ready their muskets,"
5346,5346,then aim...
5347,5347,"Still, Marion and the Americans don't move..."
5348,5348,DEAD SILENCE...
5349,5349,"Then, a single, thin voice calls out from the British"
5350,5350,lines...
5351,5351,"IN A THUNDEROUS, MASSIVE VOLLEY, three thousand British"
5352,5352,muskets fire simultaneously... just as the entire line of
5353,5353,AMERICAN MILITIAMEN DIVE TO THE GROUND...
5354,5354,"Many Americans are saved by the move but many, many others"
5355,5355,are torn apart by the British musketballs...
5356,5356,THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IS INCREDIBLE... it obscures
5357,5357,everything.  Each musket spits out a billow of think white
5358,5358,smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of
5359,5359,"them just fired.  The massive, opaque white cloud quickly"
5360,5360,spreads over the entire battlefield.
5361,5361,The astonished Redcoats instantly reload...
5362,5362,And watch as the Americans rise in DISORDERLY PANIC and
5363,5363,FLEE...
5364,5364,Some Redcoats laugh...
5365,5365,"ON A RISE BEHIND THE BATTLEFIELD, CORNWALLIS, watches"
5366,5366,"through his spyglass, trying to get a sense of what's"
5367,5367,happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke
5368,5368,obscures everything.
5369,5369,He barks to his SIGNALMAN...

5373,5373,The Signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the

5375,5375,MARION AND HIS MEN are caught in the middle of the chaotic

5377,5377,"THE BRITISH LINE advances at a quickstep, bayonets"

5379,5379,"From behind them, THE GREEN DRAGOONS appear, at a full"

5381,5381,THE BATTLEFIELD
5382,5382,It's an astonishing sight... total madness... hell... a
5383,5383,painting by Hieronymous Bosch...   
5384,5384,The mass of the British infantry charges after the fleeing
5385,5385,Patriot militiamen...
5386,5386,The Redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs...
5387,5387,TARLETON AND THE BRITISH CAVALRY THUNDERS to the head of
5388,5388,"the Redcoats, closing in on the fleeing Patriots.  The"
5389,5389,cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter...
5390,5390,THEN SUDDENLY
5391,5391,"Stepping into view from behind a low, grass covered rise,"
5392,5392,"a SOLID LINE OF BLUE APPEARS, rock solid..."
5393,5393,"It open up, allowing the fleeing Patriots to pass through"
5394,5394,it like water...
5395,5395,"then it closes again, becoming a solid blue wall..."
5396,5396,"MARION, HIS MEN AND THE ENTIRE MASS OF FLEEING MILITIA"
5397,5397,"STOPS DEAD, turns and joins the blue American line..."
5398,5398,"A flurry of orders, then the BLUE WALL ERUPTS WITH A"
5399,5399,VOLLEY of musket fire that stops the disorderly British
5400,5400,advance in its tracks...
5401,5401,Hundreds of Redcoats fall instantly...
5402,5402,Hundreds of Green Dragoons and their horses fall with
5403,5403,them...
5404,5404,The effect of the volley is devastating...'
5405,5405,The American timing is perfect...
5406,5406,"Again, the amount of SMOKE is astonishing... visibility"
5407,5407,drops to less than twenty feet in most places...
5408,5408,Drifting smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and
5409,5409,there but it is primarily a battle of sound...
5410,5410,Men simply follow the men in front of them...
5411,5411,The Blue Continentals advance in an orderly manner from
5412,5412,"both flanks onto the Redcoats, trapping them..."
5413,5413,The Redcoats try to flee...
5414,5414,"Fighting small, gathered holding actions..."
5415,5415,MARION FIRES one of his pistols...
5416,5416,Draws his sword...
5417,5417,Slashes downward... killing one Redcoat after another...
5418,5418,"No remorse, no hesitation, no pity..."
5419,5419,"A relentless, simple battle..."
5420,5420,Slashing through the Redcoat infantry...
5421,5421,His sword sinks into the stock of an upraised British
5422,5422,musket and is pulled from his hands...
5423,5423,Marion quickly kills the Redcoat with his pistol...
5424,5424,"THEN, THROUGH THE SMOKE, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF"
5425,5425,TARLETON...
5426,5426,Marion freezes... his eyes locked on Tarleton who is
5427,5427,"fighting a pitched battle, making his way toward the"
5428,5428,"perimeter of the field, trying to escape back to the"
5429,5429,British lines...
5430,5430,"Seeing nothing but Tarleton, Marion hurriedly tears open"
5431,5431,his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made
5432,5432,from Thomas' lead soldiers...
5433,5433,"As he loads the pistol, his eyes still trained on"
5434,5434,"Tarleton, Dalton runs up in the chaos..."
5435,5435,"				DALTON"
5436,5436,"		COLONEL!  OUR LINE!"
5437,5437,Marion finishes reloading... distracted he turns to Dalton

5439,5439,"				DALTON"
5440,5440,"		OUR LINE IS FALTERING..."
5441,5441,"Marion takes a quick glance at the Continental line,"
5442,5442,seeing...
5443,5443,"Scott, Rev. Oliver, Abner and a dozen more of his men, in"
5444,5444,"the middle of a confused battle, with a larger mass of"
5445,5445,Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental
5446,5446,line...
5447,5447,MARION IS TORN...
5448,5448,"He looks to Tarleton, seeing him distracted, vulnerable"
5449,5449,but too distant a target for the pistol...
5450,5450,Then Marion looks to Rev. Oliver and the others... Dalton
5451,5451,can't wait... he runs off...
5452,5452,Marion wavers...
5453,5453,Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to
5454,5454,help the faltering Patriots...
5455,5455,TARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees
5456,5456,"Marion himself, his back exposed..."
5457,5457,AT THE PATRIOT LINE...
5458,5458,"Marion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen"
5459,5459,"arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats..."
5460,5460,"As blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line, FIRING AT"
5461,5461,THE FALTERING REDCOATS...
5462,5462,TARLETON sees Marion and fights his way toward him...
5463,5463,"Marion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the American"
5464,5464,line...
5465,5465,"Tarleton mounts a terrified, riderless horses, draws his"
5466,5466,"sword and gallops back toward the British lines, on a path"
5467,5467,that takes him directly past Marion...
5468,5468,Tarleton gets closer... raises his sword... slashes...
5469,5469,Marion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of
5470,5470,his eye...
5471,5471,"Diverts the blow, knocking Tarleton from the mount..."
5472,5472,"Tarleton hits the ground... Marion draws his pistol, about"
5473,5473,to fire at Tarleton...
5474,5474,"Tarleton KICKS OUT, knocking the pistol from Marion's"
5475,5475,hand...
5476,5476,"Tarleton GRABS HIS SWORD, SLASHES AT MARION who dodges the"
5477,5477,blow...
5478,5478,"Tarleton advances... Marion scrambles back, then rises..."
5479,5479,Marion grabs a BROKEN CAVALRY LANCE and FENDS OFF REPEATED
5480,5480,BLOWS from Tarleton's SWORD...
5481,5481,"Then Marion sees his pistol, loaded with a bullet from"
5482,5482,"Thomas' lead soldiers, lying on the ground..."
5483,5483,Marion makes his way toward the weapon... still BLOCKING
5484,5484,BLOWS from Tarleton's sword...
5485,5485,Marion focuses on the pistol... leaving himself exposed...
5486,5486,Tarleton sees the OPENING... MOVES ON MARION... TARLETON
5487,5487,"RAISES HIS SWORD, about to deliver the killing blow..."
5488,5488,Marion dives... GRABS HIS PISTOL... FIRES... KILLING
5489,5489,TARLETON WITH A SHOT TO THE CHEST...
5490,5490,"Marion, stunned, exhausted and surprised to be alive,"
5491,5491,watches Tarleton fall...
5492,5492,Marion stands over Tarleton's body and gives himself a
5493,5493,"moment of bitter triumph, then he turns back to the battle"
5494,5494,at hand...
5495,5495,Marion picks up Tarleton's sword and runs to the AMERICAN
5496,5496,LINE which stiffens as Dalton and Rev. Oliver are joined
5497,5497,by Marion and a dozen other Patriots...
5498,5498,The blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line...
5499,5499,"Marion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body,"
5500,5500,"along with the place and the moment of his death, has"
5501,5501,disappeared into the smoke of the battle...
5502,5502,"Marion and his men fight on... then, Redcoats start"
5503,5503,fleeing the field...
5504,5504,First one Redcoat at a time... then more and more...
5505,5505,
5506,5506,  YORKTOWN - DAWN
5507,5507,"The next day.  Silence.  The battlefield, as far as the"
5508,5508,"eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men"
5509,5509,and scattered weapons.
5510,5510,The British have retreated back behind their defenses but
5511,5511,have left many of their men on the field.
5512,5512,"The Patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their"
5513,5513,barricades.
5514,5514,"Then, a single figure appears on one of the British"
5515,5515,"parapets.  A DRUMMER BOY, no more than ten-years-old."
5516,5516,"Behind him, a single British officer."
5517,5517,They boy begins to beat the drum.  The officer raises a
5518,5518,white flag.
5519,5519,"In the American lines, the men see the flag.  Some call"
5520,5520,"out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them MARION,"
5521,5521,simply take a deep breath.  It's finally over.
5522,5522,
5523,5523,  YORKTOWN FIELD - DAY
5524,5524,"A massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on"
5525,5525,the cleaned up battlefield.
5526,5526,"Thousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well-"
5527,5527,directed actors in a grand theatrical performance.
5528,5528,"The French and American armies, fifteen thousand men"
5529,5529,"between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of"
5530,5530,"the field, forming an avenue for the British army which"
5531,5531,marches out of it's fortification.
5532,5532,"At the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand"
5533,5533,waiting.
5534,5534,"A musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly"
5535,5535,"plays a tune, \""The World Turned Upside Down,\"" a jaunty"
5536,5536,British air with a melancholy undercurrent.
5537,5537,"CORNWALLIS marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead,"
5538,5538,covering his agony as best he can.
5539,5539,As he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the
5540,5540,South Carolina militia.
5541,5541,"MARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott"
5542,5542,and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass...
5543,5543,"CORNWALLIS glances over, noting what unit they are by a"
5544,5544,tattered battle standard that flies over them.  It's only
5545,5545,"a glance and he DOESN'T PICK OUT MARION, who is just one"
5546,5546,man among the many...
5547,5547,AT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE
5548,5548,Cornwallis reaches Washington.  They exchange unheard
5549,5549,formal greetings.
5550,5550,"Cornwallis, DRAWS HIS SWORD AND HANDS IT TO WASHINGTON..."
5551,5551,"FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN, American and French, RAISE THEIR"
5552,5552,VOICES in a CHEER OF ASTONISHING VOLUME...
5553,5553,With every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony
5554,5554,"between Washington and Cornwallis, MARION quietly and"
5555,5555,"unnoticed, slips out the back of the formation and walks"
5556,5556,away.
5557,5557,
5558,5558,  YORKTOWN - DAY
5559,5559,"The surrender ceremony continues.  Marion, on the fringe"
5560,5560,"of the field, finishes saddling his horses and prepares to"
5561,5561,leave.  LEE walks out of the crowd and joins him.  They
5562,5562,"lock eyes for a moment, then Marion mounts up."
5563,5563,"				LEE"
5564,5564,"		Goodbye, Francis."
5565,5565,"				MARION"
5566,5566,"		Goodbye, Harry."
5567,5567,Marion reaches down.  They shake hands.
5568,5568,"				MARION"
5569,5569,"		And congratulations on the birth of"
5570,5570,"		your son."
5571,5571,"				LEE"
5572,5572,"		Thank you.  Maybe all of this will"
5573,5573,"		buy him some peace."
5574,5574,"				MARION"
5575,5575,"		I hope so."
5576,5576,"As Marion starts to ride off, he reins back and stops,"
5577,5577,speaking back to Lee over his shoulder.
5578,5578,"				MARION"
5579,5579,"		Your son, what did you name him?"
5580,5580,"				LEE"
5581,5581,"		Robert.  Robert E. Lee."
5582,5582,Marion smiles.
5583,5583,"				MARION"
5584,5584,"		A good name for a farmer."
5585,5585,Lee nods.  Marion rides off.
5586,5586,
5587,5587,  CHERAW FALLS - DAY
5588,5588,Marion's children and Charlotte sit by the river.  Samuel
5589,5589,sits on the lookout ledge with his musket.  Suddenly he
5590,5590,"stands, looking out, seeing something."
5591,5591,Charlotte and the others notice.  They're worried.  Then
5592,5592,they see Samuel throw down his musket and tear down the
5593,5593,"path, running as fast as he can, tumbling, then regaining"
5594,5594,his feet...
5595,5595,Charlotte and the others know who's coming...
5596,5596,The children take off running after Samuel...
5597,5597,Racing toward the road...
5598,5598,Charlotte hurries after them...
5599,5599,AND THEN THEY SEE HIM...
5600,5600,"MARION, riding at a full gallop..."
5601,5601,The children cry out with tears of joy...
5602,5602,MARION see Susan...
5603,5603,He gallops toward her...
5604,5604,LEANS OVER...
5605,5605,"Without slowing, he SWOOPS HER UP into the saddle..."
5606,5606,She wraps herself around him...
5607,5607,"He reins back, stops and dismounts, just as the other"
5608,5608,children reach him...
5609,5609,They throw themselves into his arms... embracing him...
5610,5610,Charlotte hurries up behind them...
5611,5611,She and Marion lock eyes and he is enveloped by the hugs
5612,5612,of his children.
5613,5613,
5614,5614,  POND BLUFF - EVENING
5615,5615,Summer.  The apple tree at the top of the hill is covered
5616,5616,with apples.
5617,5617,Marion's house is partially rebuilt and habitable.  The
5618,5618,workshop is already completed.
5619,5619,"MARION'S CHILDREN, Nathan, Samuel, Margaret and William,"
5620,5620,play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two
5621,5621,GREAT DANES.
5622,5622,"CHARLOTTE sits on the front porch, NURSING AN INFANT."
5623,5623,"MARION walks out of his workshop, trailed by Susan.  He"
5624,5624,carries a just-completed rocking chair.
5625,5625,"The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web"
5626,5626,"of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue."
5627,5627,He steps onto the porch next to Charlotte and places the
5628,5628,rocking chair next to her.
5629,5629,"				MARION"
5630,5630,"		Two pounds, fourteen ounces."
5631,5631,"				CHARLOTTE"
5632,5632,"		Lovely."
5633,5633,He smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's
5634,5634,"position.  Then he sits down, settles back and begins"
5635,5635,rocking.  Not a creak.
5636,5636,"Marion and Charlotte watch Susan run out of the yard,"
5637,5637,calling as she joins the other children.
5638,5638,"				SUSAN"
5639,5639,"		Wait for me..."
5640,5640,"As the CAMERA CRANES UP, Marion and Charlotte disappear"
5641,5641,"beneath the overhang of the porch roof.  Suddenly, the"
5642,5642,SOUND OF A CRASH.
5643,5643,"				MARION (O.S.)"
5644,5644,"		Damnation!"
5645,5645,The CAMERA CONTINUES TO CRANE UP as Marion walks off the
5646,5646,"porch, crosses the yard and enters his workshop.  A moment"
5647,5647,"later, the SOUND OF MARION'S LATHE RISES."
5648,5648,"							    FADE OUT."
