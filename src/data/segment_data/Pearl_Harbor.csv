8,8,                          EARLY DRAFT
9,9,"	Out of BLACK we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by."
10,10,"	"
11,11,  POV OF AN AIRPLANE
12,12,"	Flying over American heartland.  We see the earth through the"
13,13,"	pilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the"
14,14,"	plane swooping down and storming over the ground."
15,15,"	THE PLANE"
16,16,"	is a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants.  It"
17,17,"	releases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again..."
18,18,"	Up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like"
19,19,"	honey over family farms stretching to the horizon.  Maybe"
20,20,"	it's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee.  But as long as"
21,21,"	there's been an America, men have fought and died for this"
22,22,"	place -- as volunteers."
23,23,"	Far off, but visible from the plane is"
24,24,"	A BARN - DAY"
25,25,"	The barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says"
26,26,"	\""McCawley Crop Dusting.\"" Another plane noise, this one made"
27,27,"	by kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an"
28,28,"	old plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats,"
29,29,"	and wheels."
30,30,"	The boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg"
31,31,"	they've replaced the seat with.  They've even attached a 2x4"
32,32,"	as propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help.  They"
33,33,"	wear overalls and have bowl haircuts:  RAFE and DANNY, 10"
34,34,"	years old."
35,35,"					RAFE"
36,36,"			Bandits at 2 o'clock."
37,37,"					DANNY"
38,38,"			Power dive!"
39,39,"	They buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls,"
40,40,"	Rafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other."
41,41,"					RAFE"
42,42,"			It's Germans!"
43,43,"					DANNY"
44,44,"			Kill the bastards!"
45,45,"	Rafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go"
46,46,"	right back into their game, manufacturing their own machine"
47,47,"	gun and engine sounds."
48,48,"					RAFE"
49,49,"			Good shooting, Danny!"
50,50,"					DANNY"
51,51,"			Good shooting, Rafe!"
52,52,"					RAFE"
53,53,"			Land of the free..."
54,54,"					DANNY"
55,55,"			Home of the brave!"
56,56,"					RAFE"
57,57,"			There's another one!"
58,58,"	Their vocal motors roar again... But a man's hand grabs Danny"
59,59,"	by the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit."
60,60,"	It's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his"
61,61,"	hair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still"
62,62,"	left -- are rotting.  He's also missing an arm; but the one"
63,63,"	that's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it."
64,64,"					DANNY'S FATHER"
65,65,"			You no count boy!  Johnson come lookin',"
66,66,"			said he'd pay a dime for you to shovel"
67,67,"			his pig shed, and I can't find you no"
68,68,"			place."
69,69,"					DANNY"
70,70,"			Daddy, I told you I was comin' here."
71,71,"	His father slaps him off his feet.  Rafe is so horrified he"
72,72,"	can't get a sound out.  Danny isn't even surprised.  But when"
73,73,"	his father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps"
74,74,"	so tight they choke him, he struggles.  It does no good; his"
75,75,"	father starts marching across the field, dragging and"
76,76,"	strangling Danny."
77,77,"					DANNY"
78,78,"			Da!... Dad..."
79,79,"	The father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until"
80,80,"	CRACK!  The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking"
81,81,"	him to the ground and making him drop Danny."
82,82,"	The father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the"
83,83,"	2x4 like a bat."
84,84,"					RAFE"
85,85,"			Let him alone!"
86,86,"	The father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet."
87,87,"					DANNY"
88,88,"			Rafe... Daddy... No!"
89,89,"	The man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board."
90,90,"					RAFE"
91,91,"			I'll bust you open, you...German!"
92,92,"	The words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken"
93,93,"	brain.  He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom"
94,94,"	of blood to his mouth.  He wipes it with his hand, but blood"
95,95,"	clings to his teeth.  He chokes out --"
96,96,"					DANNY'S FATHER"
97,97,"			I fought the Germans."
98,98,"	He looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's"
99,99,"	just done.  He turns and staggers away."
100,100,"	Danny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by"
101,101,"	something deeper than blood.  Then Danny runs off after his"
102,102,"	father."
103,103,"					DANNY"
104,104,"			Daddy!  Daddy!  Wait."
105,105,"	Danny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away"
106,106,"	with him."
107,107,"	The crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind"
108,108,"	Rafe.  The pilot, RAFE'S FATHER, shuts off the engine."
109,109,"					RAFE'S FATHER"
110,110,"			What's goin' on, son?"
111,111,"					RAFE"
112,112,"			Nothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get"
113,113,"			him."
114,114,"	Rafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4"
115,115,"	propeller.  His father looks toward Danny and his father,"
116,116,"	walking away, then looks at his own son."
117,117,"					RAFE'S FATHER"
118,118,"			Hey, boy -- you wanna go up?"
119,119,"	Rafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his"
120,120,"	father's lap.  As his father cranks the engine and tucks him"
121,121,"	into the harness, Rafe says --"
122,122,"					RAFE"
123,123,"			Daddy, sometime will you take Danny up"
124,124,"			too?"
125,125,"					RAFE'S FATHER"
126,126,"			Sure will, son."
127,127,"	The engine races to life...and we --"
128,128,"							DISSOLVE TO:"
129,129,"	"
130,130,  NEW JERSEY AIR BASE - DAY
131,131,"	American P-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming"
132,132,"	and wind singing by their wings."
133,133,"	There are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we"
134,134,"	focus on two:  RAFE MCCAWLEY has grown lean and handsome."
135,135,"	And DANNY WALKER is very much the same."
136,136,"	Their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while"
137,137,"	the other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and"
138,138,"	Danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high,"
139,139,"	the other diving and coming back up in his place,"
140,140,"	leapfrogging."
141,141,"	It scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and"
142,142,"	out, so close.  The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through"
143,143,"	binoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --"
144,144,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
145,145,"			McCawley!  Walker!  Cut that out!"
146,146,"					RAFE"
147,147,"			I thought this was a training flight."
148,148,"			I'm just trying to give Danny some"
149,149,"			training."
150,150,"					DANNY"
151,151,"			Not on your best day, boy!"
152,152,"	Rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction"
153,153,"	he was moving before.  Danny reacts almost instantly..."
154,154,"	leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out"
155,155,"	of everybody else."
156,156,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
157,157,"			That's it, get into a wedge!"
158,158,"	The squadron responds, forming up into a tight V, Rafe and"
159,159,"	Danny just behind and on either side of the center."
160,160,"					RAFE"
161,161,"			Didn't you say test the limits?"
162,162,"					DANNY"
163,163,"			Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better"
164,164,"			line up a couple dozen women on the"
165,165,"			GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the"
166,166,"			air!"
167,167,"	Rafe grins, loving the challenge.  Then he and Danny do the"
168,168,"	leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the V."
169,169,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
170,170,"			Everybody down!"
171,171,"	"
172,172,  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - DAY
173,173,"	The planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut"
174,174,"	down their props, slide back the canopies and hop down.  We"
175,175,"	see young pilots we'll get to know:  ANTHONY, BILLY, RED."
176,176,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
177,177,"			Where are McCawley and Walker?"
178,178,"	"
179,179,  RAFE AND DANNY - STILL IN THE AIR - DAY
180,180,"	They've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now"
181,181,"	heading right at each other, like two bullets playing"
182,182,"	chicken."
183,183,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
184,184,"			Aw shit..."
185,185,"	"
186,186,  THE COCKPITS
187,187,"	From Rafe and Danny's POV, the rush is awesome."
188,188,"	THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND watch in awe as the P-40's get so"
189,189,"	close they can't possibly get out of each other's way."
190,190,"	Billy, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown"
191,191,"	out the sound of the collision..."
192,192,"	At the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that"
193,193,"	their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other"
194,194,"	belly to belly."
195,195,"	IN THE COCKPITS"
196,196,"	Rafe and Danny burst out laughing."
197,197,"	THE PILOTS ON THE GROUND"
198,198,"	laugh and congratulate each other."
199,199,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
200,200,"			You know what they say... You can take the"
201,201,"			crop duster out of the country -- but"
202,202,"			don't put him in a P-40."
203,203,"	Rafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him.  Danny has"
204,204,"	Rafe's plane in his sights."
205,205,"					DANNY"
206,206,"			If I had guns I'd be chewing up your --"
207,207,"	Rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny."
208,208,"					RAFE"
209,209,"			If you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em."
210,210,"	They're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny.  But"
211,211,"	as Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and"
212,212,"	snaps the nose of his plane straight up."
213,213,"	THE OTHER PILOTS stop laughing."
214,214,"					ANTHONY"
215,215,"			He's doing an inside loop!"
216,216,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
217,217,"			Aw, shit..."
218,218,"	Danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come"
219,219,"	in behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway."
220,220,"					DANNY"
221,221,"			Yee-hawww!!!"
222,222,"	Danny taxis his plane over to join the others.  He's grinning"
223,223,"	as he slides back his cockpit cover; then --"
224,224,"					DANNY"
225,225,"			Where's Rafe?"
226,226,"	Red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the"
227,227,"	air.  Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to"
228,228,"	refasten his harness."
229,229,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
230,230,"			You're down, Walker!  That's an order!"
231,231,"					DANNY"
232,232,"			What about him?"
233,233,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
234,234,"			He's not taking my orders anymore."
235,235,"	Danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he"
236,236,"	notices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral."
237,237,"					DANNY"
238,238,"			He's gonna do it."
239,239,"					BILLY"
240,240,"			Do what?"
241,241,"					DANNY"
242,242,"			It."
243,243,"				(beat)"
244,244,"			Aw, shit.  Aw shit shit shit..."
245,245,"	RAFE'S PLANE reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above"
246,246,"	them, and seems to pause in the air."
247,247,"					DANNY"
248,248,"			I shouldn't'a done an inside loop."
249,249,"			I shouldn't'a done an inside loop."
250,250,"					BILLY"
251,251,"			Why?"
252,252,"					DANNY"
253,253,"			Cause now he's gonna do an outside loop."
254,254,"					TRAINING CAPTAIN"
255,255,"			Aw shit.  Aw shit shit shit..."
256,256,"	Anthony and Billy join in, like an involuntary chant --"
257,257,"					ANTHONY & BILLY"
258,258,"			Aw shit shit shit..."
259,259,"	RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT, is tightly controlled, yet serene.  He"
260,260,"	noses the plane into a power dive."
261,261,"	The P-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going"
262,262,"	so fast it begins to shudder."
263,263,"	THE OTHER PILOTS are transfixed.  Red is so nervous he can't"
264,264,"	get the words out."
265,265,"					RED"
266,266,"			Aw sh- sh- sh- sh-"
267,267,"					BILLY"
268,268,"			Shit."
269,269,"					RED"
270,270,"			Yeah."
271,271,"					DANNY"
272,272,"			You can do it, Rafe.  You can do it."
273,273,"	The P-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed,"
274,274,"	snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the"
275,275,"	runway.  Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the"
276,276,"	asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his"
277,277,"	head."
278,278,"	He pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside"
279,279,"	of the circle.  The plane reaches the top of its arc, and"
280,280,"	almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the"
281,281,"	earth, only this time he has very little altitude.  The plane"
282,282,"	hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the"
283,283,"	curve..."
284,284,"	And makes it full circle.  Rafe's head now is barely a foot"
285,285,"	off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted."
286,286,"	THE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers."
287,287,"	RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile."
288,288,"	He lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for"
289,289,"	the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head."
290,290,"	Danny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his"
291,291,"	canopy.  Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him."
292,292,"					DANNY"
293,293,"			You could've killed yourself, you stupid"
294,294,"			bastard!"
295,295,"	He dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe."
296,296,"					DANNY"
297,297,"			That was the most beautiful thing I ever"
298,298,"			saw."
299,299,"	"
300,300,  COLONEL DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - DAY
301,301,"	COLONEL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, mid-forties, is commander of the"
302,302,"	base.  He's as tough as he is good in the air.  And right now"
303,303,"	he's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before"
304,304,"	him."
305,305,"					DOOLITTLE"
306,306,"			There are some people who think the"
307,307,"			outside loop is reckless and"
308,308,"			irresponsible."
309,309,"					RAFE"
310,310,"			How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if"
311,311,"			you were the first man in the world to do"
312,312,"			it?"
313,313,"					DOOLITTLE"
314,314,"			Don't get smart with me, son."
315,315,"					RAFE"
316,316,"			Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous"
317,317,"			only for the kind of pilot who wants to"
318,318,"			show off, rather than inspire the other"
319,319,"			pilots in his unit.  And all you've done"
320,320,"			for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I"
321,321,"			did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir."
322,322,"			What the French call a \""homage.\"""
323,323,"					DOOLITTLE"
324,324,"			That's bullshit, son.  But it's really"
325,325,"			good bullshit."
326,326,"					RAFE"
327,327,"			Thank you, Sir."
328,328,"	Doolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's"

422,422,"	at one end of the car as it rattles along the track."
423,423,"	The other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too"

465,465,"			one line you all need to know, and you're"
466,466,"			likely to hear it from any man in a"

563,563,"			How would I know."
564,564,"	Beside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and"

646,646,"			You waited til tonight to tell me?"
647,647,"					RAFE"

651,651,"					RAFE"
652,652,"			Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make"
653,653,"			tonight memorable.  What I feel about you"
654,654,"			makes it impossible for me to say"
655,655,"			something like that.  If I don't come"
656,656,"			back, I don't want to saddle you with"
657,657,"			regret and sadness you'll carry the rest"
658,658,"			of your life."
659,659,"					EVELYN"
660,660,"			I don't know if you can choose that,"

662,662,"					RAFE"

664,664,"			love you.  And I will come back.  I'll"

666,666,"			to know if what I felt the first moment I"
667,667,"			saw you, and every minute since then, is"
668,668,"			real."

698,698,"			Then why are you looking for her?"
699,699,"					RAFE"
700,700,"			It's a test.  If I asked her to come and"

2261,2261,"			I don't know how long I was in the water."

2265,2265,"			told me to stay hidden below.  I was"
2266,2266,"			afraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some"
2267,2267,"			clothes, jumped ship, and found a church,"

2305,2305,"					RAFE"
2306,2306,"			It's all right.  Danny always said I see"

2344,2344,"	In a QUICK CUT, Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the"

2347,2347,"	But one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid,"
2348,2348,"	then quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses"

2433,2433,"			I was dead, she was grieving, you were"

2494,2494,"	They're lying there in the debris when they see the M.P."

5469,5469,"	the man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the"
5470,5470,"	face."
5471,5471,"	The officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling"
5472,5472,"	Red, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle"
5473,5473,"	too.  The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when"
5474,5474,"	Danny slams him down from behind."
5475,5475,"	The fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim"
5476,5476,"	for Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from"

5488,5488,"					RAFE"
5489,5489,"			Yes you can."
5490,5490,"	But Danny is silent, his eyes drifting shut, and in that"
5491,5491,"	moment Rafe thinks he is gone already.  Then Danny's eyes"
5492,5492,"	drift open, finding him."
5493,5493,"					DANNY"
5494,5494,"			Take care of Evelyn."
5495,5495,"	The words almost kill Rafe, filling him with grief.  From"
5496,5496,"	somewhere he finds the strength to say --"
5497,5497,"					RAFE"
5498,5498,"			I will.  And your baby."
5499,5499,"				(beat)"
5500,5500,"			You're gonna be a father."
5501,5501,"	Did Danny hear?  His eyes are closed again.  But his head"
5502,5502,"	comes up; Rafe takes it, and Danny pulls him closer to"
5503,5503,"	whisper --"
5504,5504,"					DANNY"
5505,5505,"			No.  You are."
5506,5506,"	Rafe cradles Danny in his arms.  Danny's eyes are open, but"

5509,5509,"			Danny... Land of the free... Land of the"
5510,5510,"			free..."
