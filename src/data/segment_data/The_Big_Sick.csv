16,16,              Really not that different from here. I
17,17,"              mean we played cricket, which is just a"
18,18,              spicier version of baseball. And we
19,19,"              prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five"
20,20,              times a day. And we marry someone our
21,21,"              parents find for us. Arranged marriage,"
22,22,"              you know. For me, it was probably that we"
23,23,              got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
24,24,"              later. And by a little bit later, I mean"
25,25,              we just got episode two. But other than

154,154,              reports so I looked up what cheese is and
155,155,              cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM

160,160,    Kumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not
161,161,    there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck.

179,179,                          CJ
180,180,             It was too easy. Like I wanted to

211,211,              We saw you perform.
212,212,                           KUMAIL
213,213,              Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of

215,215,"              you yelled at me, it threw me off. You"
216,216,              really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's

219,219,              I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed

222,222,"              Okay, that's a common misconception."
223,223,              Yelling anything at a comedian is
224,224,              considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
225,225,              have to be negative.

230,230,              Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.

288,288,    no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch
289,289,    watching TV.
290,290,                           KUMAIL
291,291,              So my roommate Chris is probably on the

293,293,              conversation. So no matter what- do not

310,310,"              Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know"
311,311,"              what, go for that area. I cleaned that"
312,312,              earlier this year.

332,332,                           KUMAIL
333,333,              Well air mattresses are actual
334,334,              mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
335,335,              air based comfort items.

475,475,     I'm not really - I know this sounds
476,476,     like a line - but I'm not really dating

480,480,     That's perfect because I'm not really

1963,1963,                            CJ
1964,1964,               He suggested it.
1965,1965,                            KUMAIL
1966,1966,               She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
1967,1967,               They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
1968,1968,               know medical stuff. That's what doctors
1969,1969,               do. They're good at medical stuff. This
1970,1970,               is a medically induced coma. This is
1971,1971,               their specialty.
1972,1972,                            MARY
1973,1973,               Maybe.
1974,1974,                            CHRIS
1975,1975,               It might be a good thing. She might wake
1976,1976,               up with a new skill. Like my cousin
1977,1977,"               blacked out once and when he came to, he"
1978,1978,               thought he knew a different language.

1980,1980,               Did he?
1981,1981,                            CHRIS
1982,1982,"               No, it was just gibberish that he made"
1983,1983,               up. It was brain damage.
1984,1984,     CJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out.

1988,1988,     Terry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's.
1989,1989,     Terry is pacing. Kumail walks up to them.

1991,1991,               Did you forget something?
1992,1992,                            KUMAIL
1993,1993,               Is she up yet?
1994,1994,53
1995,1995,                            TERRY
1996,1996,"               No, she's not. They won't tell us"
1997,1997,               anything. We've been here all morning.
1998,1998,                            KUMAIL
1999,1999,               I know you guys said you don't need me
2000,2000,"               to stay, but I think I'm just going to"

2003,2003,               You guys broke up. I'm not sure why
2004,2004,               you're here. You don't have to worry
2005,2005,"               about being committed to anything,"
2006,2006,               Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
2007,2007,               awake. There's no need to do it when
2008,2008,               she's unconscious.
2009,2009,                            KUMAIL
2010,2010,               It's more complicated than that--
2011,2011,                            BETH
2012,2012,               Is it? Because I know about the two-day
2013,2013,"               rule, I know about the headshots and the"
2014,2014,               secrets. She tells us everything.
2015,2015,"                      (beat, then)"
2016,2016,               You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
2017,2017,               have already done a lot.
2018,2018,     Kumail is speechless. After a beat of awkward quiet--
2019,2019,                            KUMAIL
2020,2020,               I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
2021,2021,               seat- ?
2022,2022,"     Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she"
2023,2023,     throws her sewing on it and turns away.
2024,2024,"     Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down,"
2025,2025,     facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a
2026,2026,     few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next
2027,2027,     to him.

2031,2031,"     Kumail carries his tray, spots Terry and Beth together"
2032,2032,     having a hushed conversation. He sits at a different
2033,2033,     table. Terry waves at him. Kumail heads over to them.

2035,2035,                            TERRY
2036,2036,               No reason you should eat there by

2039,2039,                     (barely looks up)
2040,2040,               It's a free country.
2041,2041,     Kumail nods. Sits down. They eat. It's awkward.
2042,2042,                            KUMAIL
2043,2043,               How's your sandwich?

2048,2048,"               You know, we're not by the water. Well,"
2049,2049,"               we are by the water, but it's a lake."
2050,2050,               There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.

2067,2067,               Anti. It was a tragedy.

2076,2076,              joke about it.

2686,2686,               I was going to East Carolina University
2687,2687,               and I was waiting tables. We met at
2688,2688,"               this coffee shop, I was waiting on him."
2689,2689,               I liked his hair. He was a teacher

2692,2692,               me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My
2693,2693,               family could not stand him. We're all

2703,2703,               Terry just stuck around. Eventually

3118,3118,              So this is the place.
3119,3119,                           TERRY
3120,3120,              Wow...this place is terrible.
3121,3121,     INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - LATER
3122,3122,     Kumail and Terry lay on separate air mattresses.
3123,3123,                           KUMAIL
3124,3124,"              Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was"
3125,3125,              saying that moving Emily could be a bad
3126,3126,              idea.
3127,3127,                           TERRY
3128,3128,              Really?
3129,3129,                           KUMAIL
3130,3130,"              Yeah, she said it could be dangerous."
3131,3131,     Terry listens but doesn't respond.
3132,3132,                           KUMAIL (CONT'D)
3133,3133,              Like...
3134,3134,                           TERRY
3135,3135,              No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything
3136,3136,              to trade places with Emily. Being a
3137,3137,"              parent, it's a nightmare. Loving"
3138,3138,              somebody this much sucks.
3139,3139,83
3140,3140,                           KUMAIL
3141,3141,               Yeah.
3142,3142,     Kumail's not sure what to say.
3143,3143,                            TERRY
3144,3144,               And I guess you've noticed some tension
3145,3145,               between Beth and me.
3146,3146,                            KUMAIL
3147,3147,               Not really. That's none of my business.
3148,3148,                            TERRY
3149,3149,"               Yeah well, it's there. Big time."
3150,3150,                            KUMAIL
3151,3151,               It's getting really late. We should go
3152,3152,               to sleep.
3153,3153,     Kumail turns off the light. A beat of quiet in the dark.
3154,3154,                            TERRY
3155,3155,               I cheated on her.

3159,3159,               I did. It was just a one night stand.
3160,3160,                           KUMAIL
3161,3161,               Okay.

3163,3163,               We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They
3164,3164,               have these teacher conferences. Who
3165,3165,               goes to a math conference to get laid?
3166,3166,                            KUMAIL

3169,3169,"               Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's"
3170,3170,               what it was.
3171,3171,                            KUMAIL
3172,3172,               Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a

3175,3175,               She just smelled so good. It was horrible
3176,3176,               too. As soon as I was finished. As soon
3177,3177,"               as I'd finished, I was like, what did you"
3178,3178,               fucking do?! What did you just do?!

3182,3182,              What did you do?! You know that moment of
3183,3183,              clarity you get right after an orgasm?
3184,3184,                           KUMAIL
3185,3185,              Yup.
3186,3186,                           TERRY
3187,3187,              I told Beth right away. I had to. She
3188,3188,              was devastated. Now she hates me.
3189,3189,                           KUMAIL
3190,3190,"              She might be mad at you, but she doesn't"
3191,3191,              hate you. You should've heard the way she
3192,3192,"              was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you"
3193,3193,              something? Why did you tell her?
3194,3194,                           TERRY
3195,3195,"              Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt."
3196,3196,                           KUMAIL
3197,3197,              Do you guys talk about it?
3198,3198,                           TERRY
3199,3199,"              Not anymore. She said she forgave me,"
3200,3200,              but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
3201,3201,              some advice Kumail. You're going to
3202,3202,              know the woman you want to spend the
3203,3203,              rest of your life with when you cheat
3204,3204,              on her. When you cheat on her and you
3205,3205,              just feel like shit.
3206,3206,                           KUMAIL
3207,3207,"              So, to fully know I love someone, I"
3208,3208,              have to cheat on them?

3210,3210,"              Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's"
3211,3211,              terrible advice.
3212,3212,     Terry is clearly fraught.
3213,3213,                           TERRY (CONT'D)
3214,3214,              Love isn't easy. That's why they call
3215,3215,              it love.
3216,3216,                           KUMAIL
3217,3217,              I don't really get that either.

3219,3219,              I know. I thought I could just start

3260,3260,                 KUMAIL
3261,3261,     Okay. So?

3273,3273,                  SHARMEEN
3274,3274,     We have left our family. We have left
3275,3275,     our home. I have missed the birth of my
3276,3276,     sister's daughter. I have not seen my
3277,3277,"     mother for fifteen years. Your father,"
3278,3278,     he had to do his graduate school.

3288,3288,"     Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer,"

3290,3290,"     comedy and embarrass us as a family,"
3291,3291,     fine. There is only one thing that we
3292,3292,     have ever asked from you: that you be a

3592,3592,                            EMILY
3593,3593,               No. Not since I was a grown up.

3597,3597,     spits out the liquid.

3603,3603,               We have to thicken your liquids for a
3604,3604,               bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough
3605,3605,               to swallow yet.

3613,3613,              until the anesthetic wears off.
3614,3614,"     Nurse Judy holds the cup for Emily again, and she sips."

3636,3636,                     (to Beth and Terry)
3637,3637,              Could I speak with you both outside?
3638,3638,     Dr Cunningham motions for them to join her in the hall.

3650,3650,               Emily has a rare condition called Adult
3651,3651,               Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned
3652,3652,               Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling
3653,3653,               still hadn't gone down even after
3654,3654,"               several days in bed, which is strange."
3655,3655,               Still's disease is when the body thinks
3656,3656,               healthy tissue is an infection so it
3657,3657,               tries to fight it. It's like a big
3658,3658,               biological misunderstanding.
3659,3659,                             TERRY

3662,3662,               We gave her anti-inflammatories and she
3663,3663,               stabilized within hours. She's gonna
3664,3664,               take time to recover but she'll be
3665,3665,               fine.

3681,3681,               You're an asshole and I don't like you.
3682,3682,                            KUMAIL
3683,3683,               I'm not an asshole. I'm really not.

3688,3688,               You have a lot of drugs in you so you're
3689,3689,               not thinking as clearly.
3690,3690,                            EMILY
3691,3691,               Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny
3692,3692,               to me. You just make me sad. You make me
3693,3693,"               sad inside of my heart, and it makes me"
3694,3694,               sad to look at you. So I think you should
3695,3695,               probably go. Just go and tell my mom I
3696,3696,               want her.
3697,3697,     Kumail doesn't know what to say.

3704,3704,               Emily wants to see you.

3707,3707,               I'm gonna head out. I don't think I
3708,3708,               should be here.

3711,3711,               living condition is a potential health
3712,3712,               risk and you're not that funny. But....
3713,3713,               you're probably not suited to do
3714,3714,               anything else either so that's
3715,3715,               troublesome--

3736,3736,               Did you ever think you'd be excited to

3740,3740,               It's so strange that we could go

3761,3761,     You gotta do it. It's going to suck at
3762,3762,     first but we'll have each other and
3763,3763,     maybe eventually get paid to write
3764,3764,     jokes. It's gonna be the best. Come on

3766,3766,                  MARY
3767,3767,     You have to come. I know you did not

3780,3780,"     Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I"

3931,3931,                family. Since I am a member of the
3932,3932,"                family, it would stand to reason that I"

3935,3935,                have to be unanimous. Standard
3936,3936,                parliamentary procedure. So all those

4291,4291,                to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in

4297,4297,                up to that day. So I was lying to my
