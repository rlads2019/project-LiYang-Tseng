9,9, THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
10,10,               Epic beauty: cobalt mountains beneath a glowering purple sky 
11,11,"               fringed with pink, as if the clouds were a lid too small for "
12,12,               the earth; a cascading landscape of boulders shrouded in 
13,13,"               deep green grass; and the blue lochs, reflecting the sky. We "

27,27,                         those who have hung heroes.
28,28,               Another noble rides in from the opposite side. Two more appear

101,101,"               William, with a boy's curiosity, touches the spurred foot of "
102,102,               the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in. It's too solid;

107,107,"               man behind him! In blind panic he darts in another direction, "
108,108,"               and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men "
109,109,"               begin to swing, making it harder for William's father and "
110,110,               older brother to fight their way to him.
111,111,                                     FATHER

140,140,               back his tears and panic.
141,141,               IN THE KITCHEN

160,160,               Young Wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the 
161,161,               stairs. He sees his father drip his finger into a jug of 
162,162,               whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop.
163,163,                                     MALCOLM WALLACE

170,170,               short swords they've tucked into grain sacks when William 
171,171,               comes out of the barn with his own horse.

176,176,"               These words from his youngest son make Malcolm pause, and "
177,177,"               kneel, to look into William's eyes."

220,220,                                     HAMISH
221,221,                         We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
222,222,                                     WILLIAM
223,223,"                         Aye, we'll get 'em."
224,224,               
225,225, HOUSE - NIGHT
226,226,"               William's face appears at the window, looking toward"
227,227,               THE DISTANT HILLS
228,228,"               of trees and heather, where there is no sign of life."
229,229,               
230,230, THE HOUSE - NIGHT
231,231,"               William has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two "
232,232,               steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he 
233,233,               is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still 
234,234,               all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside 
235,235,"               the stew, and moves up the stairs."
236,236,               
237,237, FARMHOUSE - DAWN
238,238,"               The house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn."
239,239,               
240,240, FARMHOUSE - DAWN
241,241,"               William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, "
242,242,"               and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops "
243,243,               at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed 
244,244,"               bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, "
245,245,               also unrumpled.
246,246,               IN THE KITCHEN
247,247,"               He finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted "
248,248,"               candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone."
249,249,               
250,250, HOUSE - DAY
251,251,"               William is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the "
252,252,"               hogs, while he glimpses something coming."
253,253,               THE BOY'S POV
254,254,               An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is 
255,255,"               Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers "
256,256,"               glance up at William, their faces grim..."
257,257,"               From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors "
258,258,               have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart 
259,259,"               stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where "
260,260,"               more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the "
261,261,"               ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt "
262,262,               of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact.
263,263,                                     CAMPBELL
264,264,"                         William... Come down here, lad."
265,265,"               William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... "
266,266,               but the bodies are still there.
267,267,               
268,268, HOUSE - DAY
269,269,"               It's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The "
270,270,               undertaker arrives in his hearse.
271,271,               
272,272, THE SHED - DAY
273,273,               On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is 
274,274,               preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the 
275,275,               head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.
276,276,"               Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and "
277,277,"               brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but "
278,278,               what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work.
279,279,               William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to 
280,280,               him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood.
281,281,               The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the 
282,282,               blood. But the wounds remain.
283,283,               
284,284, GRAVESIDE - DAY
285,285,"               CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We "
286,286,"               INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see "
287,287,"               the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, "
288,288,"               standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as "
289,289,               the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes 
290,290,"               into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken."
291,291,               The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.
292,292,               The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's 
293,293,               kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but 
294,294,"               no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy."
295,295,               Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his 
296,296,"               youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a "
297,297,"               beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her "
298,298,"               own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of "
299,299,               death and might suck her parents in too.
300,300,                                     PRIEST
301,301,"                         ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen."
302,302,"               With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, "
303,303,"               pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment "
304,304,               of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.
305,305,"               The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so "
306,306,               shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its 
307,307,               way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a 
308,308,               way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a 
309,309,"               Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and "
310,310,               places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.
311,311,               William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue 
312,312,               eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.
313,313,"               Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill "
314,314,"               above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, "
315,315,               he looks like the grim reaper.
316,316,               The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches 
317,317,               in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE 
318,318,"               WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, "
319,319,               permanently furious.
320,320,                                     PRIEST
321,321,                         You must be the relative of the 
322,322,"                         deceased... William, this is your "
323,323,                         Uncle Argyle.
324,324,"               Argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William."
325,325,               William stares up at this frightening figure. They are 
326,326,               interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a 
327,327,"               dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are "
328,328,               approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest...
329,329,                                     ARGYLE
330,330,                         You were wise to hurry.
331,331,               The soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down 
332,332,"               from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque."
333,333,                                     LEADER
334,334,                         Someone dead from this household?
335,335,                                     ARGYLE
336,336,"                         We just had a funeral, isn't that "
337,337,                         what it means in England as well?
338,338,                                     LEADER
339,339,                         What it means in England -- and in 
340,340,                         Scotland too -- is that rebels have 
341,341,                         forfeited their lands. We were 
342,342,                         ambushed last night. But the Scots 
343,343,                         dragged their dead away.
344,344,                                     ARGYLE
345,345,                         My brother and nephew perished two 
346,346,"                         days ago, when their hay cart turned "
347,347,                         over.
348,348,                                     LEADER
349,349,                         Then we'll just have a peek at the 
350,350,                         wounds.
351,351,                              (to his men)
352,352,                         Dig 'em up!
353,353,                                     ARGYLE
354,354,                         They've been sanctified and buried 
355,355,"                         in the holy rites of God's church, "
356,356,                         and any hand that disturbs them now 
357,357,                         takes on eternal damnation. So please -- 
358,358,                         do it.
359,359,"               Outmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. Several of "
360,360,               the farmers spit on the ground. Argyle glares at them.
361,361,                                     ARGYLE
362,362,                         Funeral's over. Go home.
363,363,               
364,364, THE KITCHEN - NIGHT
365,365,"               William and Argyle are sitting at the table, eating. Argyle "
366,366,"               has laid out a proper meal, with exact place settings."
367,367,                                     ARGYLE
368,368,"                         Not that spoon, that one's for soup. "
369,369,                         Dip away from you. And don't slurp.
370,370,               Argyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy.
371,371,                                     ARGYLE
372,372,                         We'll sleep here tonight. You'll 
373,373,                         come home with me. We'll let the 
374,374,"                         house, and the lands too; plenty of "
375,375,                         willing neighbors.
376,376,                                     WILLIAM
377,377,                         I don't want to leave.
378,378,                                     ARGYLE
379,379,"                         Didn't want your father to die either, "
380,380,                         did ya? But it happened.
381,381,               Argyle pushes his food away; he has no appetite now.
382,382,                                     ARGYLE
383,383,                         Did the priest say anything about 
384,384,                         the Resurrection? Or was it all about 
385,385,                         Judgment?
386,386,                                     WILLIAM
387,387,"                         It was in Latin, sir."
388,388,                                     ARGYLE
389,389,                         Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak 
390,390,"                         Latin? We have to fix that, won't "
391,391,                         we?
392,392,                              (beat)
393,393,                         Did he give the poetic benediction? 
394,394,                         The Lord bless thee and keep thee? 
395,395,                         Patris Benefactum et --
396,396,                              (beat)
397,397,                         ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
398,398,               
399,399, WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
400,400,               Argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed; he stands 
401,401,               awkwardly idle as William scrubs his face at the washstand 
402,402,               and crawls into bed.
403,403,                                     WILLIAM
404,404,"                         Good night, Uncle."
405,405,"               Argyle grunts and starts out. Then he stops, turns back, "
406,406,               leans down over William... and with great tenderness the 
407,407,               grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair.
408,408,               
409,409, THE KITCHEN - NIGHT
410,410,"               Argyle sits by the hearth, staring at the embers. He holds "
411,411,               the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother. He looks 
412,412,"               at the handle, like a cross. He whispers..."
413,413,                                     ARGYLE
414,414,"                         \""The Lord bless thee and keep thee...\"""
415,415,               Tears of grief spill down the old man's cheeks.
416,416,               
417,417, THE HANGING BARN - IN WILLIAM'S DREAM
418,418,"               Once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn, looking "
419,419,"               at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled "
420,420,"               hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William "
421,421,"               gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his "
422,422,"               father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they "
423,423,"               smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches "
424,424,"               to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding "
425,425,               hand.
426,426,               William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother 
427,427,               move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are 
428,428,               there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads 
429,429,"               into the nooses, and hoist themselves up."
430,430,               William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and
431,431,               HE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM
432,432,"               tears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still "
433,433,"               grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle."
434,434,               
435,435, HOUSE - NIGHT
436,436,               William moves down to the room where his uncle would be 
437,437,               sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- 
438,438,               but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to
439,439,               THE KITCHEN
440,440,               But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a 
441,441,"               strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He "
442,442,               moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the 
443,443,               window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a 
444,444,"               candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out "
445,445,"               his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind."
446,446,               
447,447, WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT
448,448,               William is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound 
449,449,               of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the 
450,450,"               moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he "
451,451,"               realizes this, then forces himself on."
452,452,               
453,453, GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
454,454,               William moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are 
455,455,"               buried, and discovers a haunting scene: two dozen men, the "
456,456,"               farmer/warriors of his neighborhood, are gathered in kilts -- "
457,457,"               and among them, a core of bagpipers. The pipes wail an ancient "
458,458,"               Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody "
459,459,"               known to us as \""Amazing Grace.\"" Uncle Argyle has heard them "
460,460,               and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the 
461,461,"               torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances "
462,462,"               down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William "
463,463,               whispers...
464,464,                                     WILLIAM
465,465,                         What are they doing?
466,466,                                     ARGYLE
467,467,                         Saying goodbye in their own way -- 
468,468,"                         in outlawed tartans, with outlawed "
469,469,"                         pipes, playing outlawed tunes."
470,470,"               The farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each "
471,471,"               whispering his own private prayer. Argyle whispers, half to "
472,472,"               William, and half to himself..."
473,473,                                     ARGYLE
474,474,"                         Your Daddy and I, we saw our own "
475,475,"                         father buried like this, dead from "
476,476,                         fighting the English.
477,477,"               William takes the sword from his uncle, and tries to lift "
478,478,               it.
479,479,"               Slowly, Argyle takes the sword back."
480,480,                                     ARGYLE
481,481,                         First learn to use this.
482,482,               He taps William on the temple with the tip of his finger.
483,483,                                     ARGYLE
484,484,                         Then I will teach you to use this.
485,485,"               With an expert's easy fluidity, he lifts the huge sword. It "
486,486,"               glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging "
487,487,"               in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising "
488,488,               towards the stars...

490,490, WALLACE FARM - DAY
491,491,               William and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon. William has 
492,492,"               a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as "
493,493,               if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back. But he does 
494,494,"               glance back just once, to see the deserted farmhouse."
495,495,                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

499,499,"               gemstones sparkling everywhere, we hear..."
500,500,                                     
501,501,"                         Twelve years later, Longshanks "
502,502,                         supervised the wedding of his eldest 
503,503,"                         son, also named Edward, who would "
504,504,                         succeed him to the throne.
505,505,"               LONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of "
506,506,               the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly 
507,507,"               legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's "
508,508,"               nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct "
509,509,               cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line 
510,510,               of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers.
511,511,                                     
512,512,"                         As bride for his son, Longshanks had "
513,513,"                         chosen a relative of his rival, the "
514,514,                         king of France.
515,515,"               GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty "
516,516,"               moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her "
517,517,               blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her 
518,518,"               hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control."
519,519,"               She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men "
520,520,               surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and 
521,521,               goes through the ceremony under his father's stare.
522,522,                                     
523,523,                         It was widely whispered that for the

525,525,                         would have to do the honors himself. 
526,526,                         That may have been what he had in 
527,527,                         mind all along.
528,528,"               The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's "
529,529,"               veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince "
530,530,"               Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted "
531,531,"               by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new "
532,532,"               Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes "
533,533,               that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise.
534,534,                                     
535,535,                         Having seen to his obligations to

537,537,                         set about his fondest business -- to

541,541,               Longshanks' narrow finger jabs Scotland.
542,542,                                     LONGSHANKS
543,543,                         Scotland! Scot-land!

546,546, ROYAL ENGLISH PALACE - DAY
547,547,"               Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the "
548,548,"               outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly "
549,549,               afraid of him.
550,550,                                     LONGSHANKS
551,551,                         The French will grovel to anyone 
552,552,                         with strength! But how will they 
553,553,                         credit our strength when we cannot 
554,554,                         rule the whole of our own island?!
555,555,"               He punches the map, then sees the Princess enter softly."
556,556,                                     LONGSHANKS
557,557,                         Where is my son?
558,558,                                     PRINCESS
559,559,"                         Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to "
560,560,                         come in his stead.
561,561,               Longshanks' eyes expand in fury; it is frightening to see.
562,562,                                     LONGSHANKS
563,563,                         I sent for him -- and the little

566,566,"                         Shall I leave, M'lord?"
567,567,                                     LONGSHANKS
568,568,"                         If he wants his queen to rule, then "
569,569,                         you stay and learn how! I will deal 
570,570,                         with him.
571,571,"               He spins back toward his generals. Ignored, the princess "
572,572,               settles silently onto the cushions of the window seat.
573,573,                                     LONGSHANKS
574,574,                         Nobles are the key to the Scottish

577,577,                         estates in the north. Make them too 
578,578,                         greedy to oppose us.
579,579,               One OLD ADVISOR speaks up hesitantly.
580,580,                                     OLD ADVISOR
581,581,                         Sire... Our nobles will be reluctant 
582,582,"                         to relocate. New lands mean new taxes, "
583,583,                         and they are taxed already for our 
584,584,                         war in France.
585,585,"               Longshanks glares at him, but takes the point. The wheels "
586,586,"               grind in his brain; his dark eyes falling on the Princess, "
587,587,               he is inspired.

589,589,                         Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an

595,595,                         That should fetch just the kind of

598,598, PRINCE EDWARD'S ROYAL APARTMENTS - DAY
599,599,"               The prince and a muscular young friend, PHILLIP, are stripped "
600,600,               to the waist and fencing. They pay no attention to the
601,601,"               KNOCK, or to the Princess as she enters. She watches them -- "
602,602,               they are dancing more than fencing. Edward loses his sword; 
603,603,"               it clatters to the polished floor. He looks up at his wife, "
604,604,               as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness.
605,605,                                     EDWARD
606,606,                         What is it?!
607,607,                                     PRINCESS
608,608,                         You directed me to report to you the 
609,609,                         moment the king's conference was 
610,610,                         ended.
611,611,                                     EDWARD
612,612,                         So I did! And what was so important 
613,613,                         about it?
614,614,                                     PRINCESS
615,615,                         Scotland. He intends --
616,616,"               But Edward and his friend are fencing again, the clanging of "
617,617,               their blunted swords so loud that she can't hear herself.
618,618,                                     PRINCESS
619,619,                         He intends to grant --
620,620,"               Edward loses his weapon again, and whirls on her."
621,621,                                     EDWARD
622,622,"                         Shut up, would you! How can I "
623,623,                         concentrate?!
624,624,                                     PRINCESS
625,625,                         ...His majesty was quite keen that

630,630,"               For an instant, anger flares into her eyes. She glances at "
631,631,"               Edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes "
632,632,               and starts to back out. But Edward has noticed.
633,633,                                     EDWARD
634,634,                         Stop there.
635,635,"               She stops, but does not raise her eyes."
636,636,                                     EDWARD
637,637,                         Do you disapprove of Phillip?
638,638,               He lifts his hand and draws his friend Phillip to his side.
639,639,               Still the Princess does not lift her eyes.
640,640,                                     PRINCESS
641,641,                              (barely audible)
642,642,"                         No, M'lord."
643,643,                                     EDWARD
644,644,                         Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
645,645,               She lifts her eyes. But she could not brace herself enough 
646,646,"               for what she sees: Edward nuzzling Phillip, the prince's "
647,647,"               bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men "
648,648,               glistening with sweat and sexual excitement.
649,649,               The Princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away.
650,650,                                     EDWARD
651,651,"                         Now, my flower, do you understand?"
652,652,                                     PRINCESS
653,653,                         Yes. I had thought that... I was 
654,654,                         loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I 
655,655,"                         may be excused, M'lord."
656,656,                                     EDWARD
657,657,                         You may.
658,658,"               She starts to leave, as quietly as she came. But her husband "
659,659,               calls after her.
660,660,                                     EDWARD
661,661,"                         Don't worry, m'Lady, it is my royal "
662,662,                         responsibility to breed. And I assure 
663,663,"                         you, when the time comes, I shall... "
664,664,                         manage.
665,665,"               She closes the door softly, on her husband and his lover."
666,666,                                     
667,667,                         Now in Edinburgh were gathered the 
668,668,                         council of Scottish nobles...
669,669,               ESTABLISHING COUNCIL - DAY
670,670,"               The picturesque heart of Scotland, with its CASTLE on a fairy "
671,671,               tale plateau above the Firth of Forth.
672,672,               
673,673, EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY
674,674,               The nobles are gathered around a huge table. They rise at 
675,675,"               the entrance of young ROBERT THE BRUCE, a handsome young "
676,676,"               man, full of intelligence and power."
677,677,                                     
678,678,"                         Among these was Robert, the 17th "
679,679,"                         Earl of Bruce, a leading contender "
680,680,                         for the crown of Scotland.
681,681,"               Robert strides to his seat in the center of the table, and "
682,682,"               the others settle in respectfully. MORNAY, another young "
683,683,"               warrior, gives him a bow, as does CRAIG, a grizzled noble."
684,684,                                     CRAIG
685,685,"                         Young Robert, we are honored --"
686,686,                                     ROBERT
687,687,                         My father hears that Longshanks has 
688,688,                         granted prima noctes.
689,689,                                     CRAIG
690,690,                         Clearly meant to draw more of his 
691,691,                         supporters here.
692,692,                                     MORNAY
693,693,                         The Balliol clan has endorsed the

695,695,                         he will support their claim to the 
696,696,                         throne. If we make a show of 
697,697,"                         opposition, the commoners will favor "
698,698,                         us.
699,699,                                     ROBERT
700,700,                         It is too soon to step out alone. My 
701,701,                         father believes we must lull 
702,702,"                         Longshanks into confidence, by neither "
703,703,                         supporting his decree nor opposing 
704,704,                         it.
705,705,                                     CRAIG
706,706,                         A wise plan. And how is your father? 
707,707,                         We have missed him at the council.
708,708,                                     ROBERT
709,709,                         He strained his leg so that it pains 
710,710,                         him to ride. But he sends his 
711,711,                         greetings -- and says that I speak 
712,712,                         for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
713,713,               
714,714," SCOTTISH VILLAGE, AT THE EDGE OF TOWN - DAY"
715,715,               Flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families 
716,716,               have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy 
717,717,               bride and groom. Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of 
718,718,               cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of 
719,719,               smoked fish.
720,720,"               And watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers, "
721,721,               battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears.
722,722,"               Riding along the road comes William Wallace. Grown now, a "
723,723,"               man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, "
724,724,"               his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled "
725,725,               power. He looks dangerous.
726,726,"               And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes."
727,727,               He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he 
728,728,               stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the 
729,729,               scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing 
730,730,               handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the 
731,731,               traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing 
732,732,"               William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters "
733,733,               of marriageable age.
734,734,"               Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older "
735,735,"               now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William "
736,736,               dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. One of the English 
737,737,               SOLDIERS shoves William from behind.
738,738,                                     SOLDIER
739,739,                         Hey boy! You hunt this bird?
740,740,               William's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.
741,741,                                     SOLDIER
742,742,                         It's against the law for Scots to 
743,743,                         own bows. You shot this bird?
744,744,"               His buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the "
745,745,               bird and begin to search it for evidence.
746,746,                                     WILLIAM
747,747,                         I hit it in the head. With a rock.
748,748,               They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture 
749,749,               wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return 
750,750,               of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground.
751,751,"               Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing."
752,752,               The farmers watch him come.
753,753,"               Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not "
754,754,"               to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young "
755,755,               woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long 
756,756,"               ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her "
757,757,"               back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a "
758,758,"               wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, "
759,759,"               maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William "
760,760,               notice her too.
761,761,               William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to 
762,762,               the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.
763,763,                                     WILLIAM
764,764,                         Miz MacDougal. You look well.
765,765,                                     FARM WOMAN
766,766,"                         ...William? It's William Wallace, "
767,767,                         back home! -- Have you met my 
768,768,                         daughter?
769,769,               The daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to 
770,770,               her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright 
771,771,"               as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But "
772,772,               then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand 
773,773,               and gives her a respectful bow.
774,774,"               He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like "
775,775,               a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He 
776,776,"               sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember "
777,777,"               each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes "
778,778,"               downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him."
779,779,               They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about 
780,780,"               to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth "
781,781,               at Williams' feet.
782,782,"               He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, "
783,783,               muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's 
784,784,               way. Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle 
785,785,"               the challenge. He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him "
786,786,               off. Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.
787,787,                                     WILLIAM
788,788,                         Hamish?
789,789,"               It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put "
790,790,               off from the challenge. He points to the huge stone.
791,791,                                     HAMISH
792,792,                         Test of manhood.
793,793,                                     WILLIAM
794,794,                         You win.
795,795,                                     HAMISH
796,796,                              (blocks him)
797,797,"                         Call it a test of soldiery, then. "
798,798,                         The English won't let us train with 
799,799,"                         weapons, so we train with stones."
800,800,                                     WILLIAM
801,801,                         The test of a soldier is not in his 
802,802,                         arm. It's here.
803,803,"               He taps his temple. Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to "
804,804,               show William something in his palm.
805,805,                                     HAMISH
806,806,                         No. It's here.
807,807,"               With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's "
808,808,"               jaw, dropping him. A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, "
809,809,"               MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders "
810,810,"               here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. Hamish stands "
811,811,"               over William, waiting for him to get up."
812,812,                                     WILLIAM
813,813,"                         A contest, then."
814,814,"               William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in "
815,815,"               diameter. Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to "
816,816,               the line scratched in the rocky field. Beyond the line are 
817,817,               the muddy dents from previous tosses. William takes a run 
818,818,               and heaves the stone. It flies past the other marks in the 
819,819,               field; people are impressed. William looks at Hamish.
820,820,                                     WILLIAM
821,821,                         I still say this is no test. A 
822,822,                         catapult can throw a stone farther 
823,823,                         than a man can.
824,824,                                     HAMISH
825,825,                         That depends on the man.
826,826,"               Hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the "
827,827,               line. He takes a run and heaves with a great groan! The stone 
828,828,"               flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet."
829,829,"               People laugh and whistle. William nods, impressed."
830,830,                                     WILLIAM
831,831,                         Can you do it when it matters? As it 
832,832,                         matters in battle? Could you crush a 
833,833,                         man with that throw?
834,834,                                     HAMISH
835,835,                         I could crush you like a roach.
836,836,               William walks to the dent made by Hamish's throw.
837,837,                                     WILLIAM
838,838,"                         Then do it. Come, do it."
839,839,"               Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching. He lifts "
840,840,               the stone and carries it back to the line. William stands 
841,841,               calmly. Hamish backs up for his run. William yawns.
842,842,                                     HAMISH
843,843,                         You'll move
844,844,                                     WILLIAM
845,845,                         I will not.
846,846,"               Hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run."
847,847,                                     FARMER STEWART
848,848,                         That's not fair!
849,849,                                     CAMPBELL
850,850,"                         He's tired, he should get a longer "
851,851,                         run.
852,852,"               William seems completely unafraid. He leans down, picks up a "
853,853,               small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually.
854,854,"               Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and "
855,855,"               heaves! The stone flies through the air, just misses William's "
856,856,"               head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. "
857,857,               William never flinches. The people cheer.
858,858,                                     CAMPBELL
859,859,                         Brave show!
860,860,               Hamish is miffed; it's like William won.
861,861,                                     HAMISH
862,862,                         I threw longer than last time!
863,863,                                     CAMPBELL
864,864,"                         An ox is strong, but not clever."
865,865,                                     HAMISH
866,866,                         An ox is stupid enough to just stand 
867,867,                         in one place.
868,868,                                     WILLIAM
869,869,                         That's not the point.
870,870,"               William turns, walks double the distance Hamish threw, and "
871,871,               turns and hurls the rock he holds! It whistles through the 
872,872,"               air, hits Hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot."
873,873,                                     WILLIAM
874,874,                         That is.
875,875,               Everybody cheers and laughs! They surround William.
876,876,                                     CAMPBELL
877,877,"                         A fine display, young Wallace!"
878,878,"               William takes a tankard of ale from a farmer, walks over and "
879,879,"               tosses the cold liquid into Hamish's face; he wakes, and, "
880,880,"               his eyes uncrossing, accepts William's hand, pulling him up."
881,881,                                     WILLIAM
882,882,                         Good to see you again.
883,883,                                     HAMISH
884,884,                         I should'a remembered the eggs.
885,885,"               Grinning, they embrace. MUSIC plays, the dancing begins."
886,886,               William walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes 
887,887,"               Marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth."
888,888,                                     WILLIAM
889,889,                         Would you honor me with a dance?
890,890,               She's thrilled to accept; they begin to dance.
891,891,                                     GIRL
892,892,                         You've taken over your father's farm?
893,893,                              (beat)
894,894,                         They say he died long ago. Fighting 
895,895,                         the English.
896,896,                                     WILLIAM
897,897,"                         He died in an accident, with my "
898,898,                         brother. Their cart turned over.
899,899,               The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily 
900,900,"               armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, "
901,901,               reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In 
902,902,"               the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, "
903,903,"               in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom."
904,904,                                     NOBLEMAN
905,905,                         I have come to claim the right of 
906,906,                         prima noctes. As the lord of these 
907,907,"                         lands, I will bless this marriage by "
908,908,                         taking the bride into my bed on the 
909,909,                         first night of her union.
910,910,"               Stewart, father of the BRIDE, lunges forward."
911,911,                                     STEWART
912,912,"                         No, by God!"
913,913,               The horsemen point their lances at the unarmed Scots -- who 
914,914,               see that the English soldiers from the village have moved to 
915,915,"               the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance."
916,916,                                     NOBLEMAN
917,917,                         It is my noble right.
918,918,"               Even unarmed, Stewart is about to attack -- but the bride "
919,919,               intervenes. She grabs her father and whispers to him. She 
920,920,"               moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, "
921,921,               she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. 
922,922,"               Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's "
923,923,               courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more 
924,924,"               unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a "
925,925,"               particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is "
926,926,               leering at her. William Wallace sees this too.
927,927,"               The noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins "
928,928,"               to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the "
929,929,"               food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, "
930,930,"               standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself."
931,931,               
932,932, THE WALLACE FARMHOUSE - MAGIC HOUR
933,933,               The farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn. William stands at 
934,934,"               the open door, and gazes out at the rain; it leaks on him, "
935,935,               through his roof; he doesn't seem to notice.
936,936,               
937,937, THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR
938,938,"               A thatched cottage, lit with a cozy fire, beneath the rain."
939,939,"               A hand KNOCKS on the door, and MacClannough opens it to find "
940,940,"               William, on a horse! MacClannough frowns."
941,941,                                     WILLIAM
942,942,"                         Good evening, sir. May I speak with "
943,943,                         your daughter?
944,944,"               Mrs. MacClannough shoulders up beside her husband, and Marion "
945,945,               appears behind her scowling parents.
946,946,                                     WILLIAM
947,947,                         Marion... Would you like to go for a 
948,948,                         ride on this fine evening?
949,949,                                     MOTHER
950,950,                         The boy's insane!
951,951,                                     WILLIAM
952,952,"                         It's good Scottish weather, Madam, "
953,953,                         the rain is fallin' straight down.
954,954,                                     MOTHER
955,955,"                         She absolutely may not, she'll -- "
956,956,                         Marion!
957,957,               Marion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door; she 
958,958,"               runs out to hop up behind William, and they gallop away."
959,959,               THE RIDE - MAGIC HOUR
960,960,"               William and Marion race along the heather, up and down hills, "
961,961,"               through swollen streams. The rain stops, as the sun sets; "
962,962,"               the Scottish mists lift, revealing stunning natural beauty."
963,963,               William stops the horse and they look out over it all 
964,964,"               together. He speaks, without turning to face her."
965,965,                                     WILLIAM
966,966,"                         Your father doesn't like me, does "
967,967,                         he?
968,968,                                     MARION
969,969,                         It's not you. He dislikes that you're 
970,970,                         a Wallace. He just says... the 
971,971,                         Wallaces don't seem to live for very 
972,972,                         long.
973,973,                                     WILLIAM
974,974,                         Thank you for accepting.
975,975,                                     MARION
976,976,                         Thank you for inviting.
977,977,                                     WILLIAM
978,978,"                         I'll invite you again, but your mother "
979,979,                         thinks I'm crazy.
980,980,                                     MARION
981,981,                         You are. And I'll come again.
982,982,"               He lingers; he wants to say something, or maybe he just "
983,983,               doesn't want the moment to end. Finally he spurs the horse.
984,984,               
985,985, THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT
986,986,               They reach the door. William hops off the horse and reaches 
987,987,"               up to help her down the moment she touches the ground, they "
988,988,               look into each other's eyes... but the door is snatched open 
989,989,               so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss.
990,990,                                     MOTHER
991,991,"                         Marion, come in!"
992,992,               He walks her closer to the door. They turn and look at each 
993,993,               other again. She waits for him to kiss her...
994,994,                                     MOTHER
995,995,"                         Marion, come in!"
996,996,               She still hesitates; he isn't going to kiss her. She starts 
997,997,"               in, but he grabs her hand. And into it he puts something he "
998,998,               has taken from his pocket; it is wrapped in flannel. He hops 
999,999,"               on his horse, glances at her, and gallops away."
1000,1000,               She stands in the open doorway; she looks down at what he 
1001,1001,"               left her. She unwraps the flannel; it is a dried thistle, "
1002,1002,               the one she gave him years before.

1005,1005,"               William is re-thatching the roof of his barn, when he hears "
1006,1006,"               riders approaching, and looks down to see that it is "
1007,1007,"               MacClannough, backed by Campbell and Hamish. Uh-oh."

1012,1012,                         invite Marion to ride last night. I

1018,1018,                                     WILLIAM
1019,1019,                         What kind of meeting?

1021,1021,                         The secret kind.
1022,1022,               William goes back to repairing his roof.
1023,1023,                                     CAMPBELL
1024,1024,                         Your father was a fighter. And a

1027,1027,                         I know who my father was. I came 
1028,1028,"                         back home to raise crops. And, God "
1029,1029,"                         willing, a family. If I can live in "
1030,1030,"                         peace, I will."
1031,1031,"               Campbell shakes his head and reins his horse away, with "
1032,1032,               Hamish. MacClannough lingers.

1036,1036,                         court my daughter. If you break your 
1037,1037,"                         intention, I'll kill you."
1038,1038,"               MacClannough rides away. William sits down on the roof, and "
1039,1039,               looks out at the graves of his father and brother.

1042,1042,"               Outside the half-timbered house, William stands in the shadows "
1043,1043,               of moonlight and tosses a pebble against the wooden upper 
1044,1044,               window. Marion opens the shutters and slips out onto the 
1045,1045,"               vines, dropping into William's arms."
1046,1046,"               Giggling, suppressing laughter, they run to the trees..."

1048,1048,"               Hand in hand through the heather they run, silhouettes along "
1049,1049,"               a ridge, their breath blowing silver clouds in the moonlight, "
1050,1050,               the Scottish wind whipping through their hair.
1051,1051,"               They stop at a grove at the edge of a precipice, overlooking "
1052,1052,               a loch gleaming in the moonlight. So beautiful it's sacred.
1053,1053,                                     MARION
1054,1054,                         You've been here before?
1055,1055,                                     WILLIAM
1056,1056,                         Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly 
1057,1057,                         dreams I don't want. I started riding 
1058,1058,                         at night to fill up my mind so that 
1059,1059,                         when I did sleep I'd dream only of 
1060,1060,                         the ride and the adventure.
1061,1061,                                     MARION
1062,1062,                         Did it work?
1063,1063,                                     WILLIAM
1064,1064,                         No. You don't choose your dreams. 
1065,1065,                         Your dreams choose you.
1066,1066,"               He looks at her. They kiss suddenly, so long and hard that "
1067,1067,"               they tumble into the heather, rolling, devouring each other."
1068,1068,               Through their passion...
1069,1069,                                     WILLIAM

1076,1076,                         Nor I!

1078,1078,                         But I won't give you up to any

1081,1081,                              (stopping)
1082,1082,                         You scare me.
1083,1083,                                     WILLIAM
1084,1084,                         I don't want to scare you. I want to 
1085,1085,"                         be yours, and you mine. Every night "
1086,1086,                         like this one.
1087,1087,                                     MARION
1088,1088,                         This night is too beautiful to have 
1089,1089,                         again.
1090,1090,                                     WILLIAM

1092,1092,                         Forever.
1093,1093,               They kiss again...

1096,1096,               Marion moves through the market. English soldiers admire her 
1097,1097,"               as she walks. She stops, looking at white lace and cloth."
1098,1098,"               William casually passes, poking a note in her basket. Subtly "
1099,1099,"               she withdraws his note, and reads:"
1100,1100,               
1101,1101,#NAME?

1106,1106,               William waits with horses. She fetches a bundle she's stashed 
1107,1107,"               in the crook of a tree, and they mount and ride off."

1110,1110,"               The church is at the base of the precipice, beside the loch."

1112,1112, THE CHURCH - NIGHT
1113,1113,               This ancient Gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by 
1114,1114,"               the occupying army, and yet it looks devoutly holy this way, "
1115,1115,               lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof. The 
1116,1116,               village PRIEST whom we saw at the wedding celebration is 
1117,1117,"               waiting at the altar. Marion steps into the confessional, as "
1118,1118,               William moves to the altar and kneels in prayer.
1119,1119,               Marion emerges; she's changed into the wedding dress she 
1120,1120,               made from the cloth she bought. William stands and watches 
1121,1121,               her float down the aisle; his whole life was worth this 
1122,1122,               moment.
1123,1123,"               Together, the two lovers turn to the priest."
1124,1124,                                     PRIEST
1125,1125,"                         You have come to pledge, each to the "
1126,1126,"                         other, before Almighty God."
1127,1127,"               From within his shirt, William withdraws a strip of cloth "
1128,1128,               woven in his family tartan. He and Marion each lift a hand 
1129,1129,"               to the priest, and he binds their wrists with the cloth."
1130,1130,                                     WILLIAM
1131,1131,                         I will love you my whole life. You 
1132,1132,                         and no other.
1133,1133,"               From her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief, embroidered "
1134,1134,               with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those 
1135,1135,               years ago.
1136,1136,                                     MARION
1137,1137,                         And I you. You and no other. Forever.
1138,1138,"               The Priest waits for them to go on, but neither can; they're "
1139,1139,"               too taken with emotion, looking at each other. The Priest "
1140,1140,               intones holy phrases...

1143,1143,"                         and keep thy love, now and forever."
1144,1144,"               The lovers kiss. As they break their embrace, a figure "
1145,1145,               carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door 
1146,1146,"               of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the "
1147,1147,               Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.
1148,1148,                                     PRIEST
1149,1149,                         I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him 
1150,1150,                         me'self. A weddin' needs pipes.
1151,1151,"               The piper begins to play, and the tune from his primitive "
1152,1152,"               chanter is wispy, ethereal, beautiful. The lovers look into "
1153,1153,"               each other's eyes, as the single melody of the pipes merges "
1154,1154,"               into a swell of music, UNDERSCORING MONTAGE"
1155,1155,"               William and Marion ride the path to the top of the precipice, "
1156,1156,"               where, in the shelter of the grove, they spend their "
1157,1157,"               honeymoon. The MUSIC CONTINUES as, still sweaty from their "
1158,1158,"               love-making, he returns her to her house just before dawn."
1159,1159,"               She waves from her window, as William rides away, as we"
1160,1160,                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

1162,1162, VILLAGE OF LANARK - DAY
1163,1163,"               It's Market Day in the village, busy with Highlanders, "
1164,1164,"               merchants of all kinds, and a few special attractions like "
1165,1165,               jugglers and fortune tellers. Marion moves along a table 
1166,1166,"               full of flowers and fruit... William, concealed behind hanging "
1167,1167,"               baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his "
1168,1168,"               beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. Then she looks "
1169,1169,"               up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she "
1170,1170,               remembers to conceal it. He moves up beside her.
1171,1171,                                     WILLIAM
1172,1172,                         I've missed you.
1173,1173,                                     MARION
1174,1174,                         Shush. It's only been a day.
1175,1175,                              (beat)
1176,1176,                         And it's seemed like forever.
1177,1177,                                     WILLIAM
1178,1178,                         Tonight then.
1179,1179,                                     MARION
1180,1180,                         My parents are growing suspicious! I 
1181,1181,                         can't keep meeting you every night!
1182,1182,"               Playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress, "
1183,1183,               pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their 
1184,1184,"               wedding, which she now wears hidden around her neck."
1185,1185,                                     WILLIAM
1186,1186,                         Then when?
1187,1187,                                     MARION
1188,1188,                         ...Tonight!
1189,1189,"               Tucking in the cloth strip, she hurries away, smiling."
1190,1190,               ANGLE - DRUNKEN ENGLISH SOLDIERS - BY AN ALE CASK - DAY
1191,1191,"               They spot Marion moving through the fair, glowing, beautiful."
1192,1192,"               The soldiers smirk at each other; as Marion passes, one of "
1193,1193,"               them grabs her wrist. It's the soldier with the scar, the "
1194,1194,               one who's been staring at her.
1195,1195,                                     SOLDIER
1196,1196,                         Where are you going... lass?
1197,1197,                                     MARION
1198,1198,                         Let go.
1199,1199,               A second drunken SOLDIER pipes up.
1200,1200,                                     SOLDIER #2
1201,1201,                         Why don't you marry my friend here? 
1202,1202,                         Then I'll take the first night!
1203,1203,               The scarred soldier pulls Marion into his big arms; she shoves 
1204,1204,"               him away with surprising strength, and he staggers back, to "
1205,1205,               the laughter of his friends. Then he snatches her again and 
1206,1206,               kisses her hard on the lips.
1207,1207,"               She breaks free and SLAPS him fiercely, hard enough to draw "
1208,1208,"               blood from his mouth. Tasting the trickle, he slings her "
1209,1209,"               down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over "
1210,1210,"               her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale "
1211,1211,               public gang rape. As the townspeople try to move in the three 
1212,1212,"               soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, "
1213,1213,               keep them townspeople back.
1214,1214,                                     SOLDIER #1
1215,1215,"                         Bitch, who do you think you are?"
1216,1216,"               He slams his mouth down against hers for a long, awful time, "
1217,1217,               comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body... and 
1218,1218,               is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed!
1219,1219,               It takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what 
1220,1220,"               just happened, and in that instant William is on them. He "
1221,1221,               wrenches one soldier's arm in a direction it was never meant 
1222,1222,"               to go, breaking the elbow, separating the shoulder, and "
1223,1223,               slinging the howling soldier into his comrades.
1224,1224,"               Two of the soldiers leap at William, swinging their short "
1225,1225,"               swords; William ducks, knocking their ale cask into their "
1226,1226,               knees; William lifts the whole table where they were sitting 
1227,1227,               and slams it into the faces of two more attackers.
1228,1228,                                     MARION
1229,1229,                         William!
1230,1230,"               She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now "
1231,1231,"               bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William "
1232,1232,"               with a knife. William sidesteps the first thrust, snatches a "
1233,1233,               leg from the shattered table and crushes the man's skull.
1234,1234,                                     MARKET WOMEN
1235,1235,                         Wallace Wallace! William Wallace!
1236,1236,               But there's no time for celebration. There's blood and ale 
1237,1237,"               everywhere, and the fallen soldiers are yelling..."
1238,1238,                                     FALLEN SOLDIER
1239,1239,                         Rebels! Help!
1240,1240,"               MORE SOLDIERS hear the call and come running, reinforcements "
1241,1241,               converging from all over the village.
1242,1242,                                     VILLAGE FOLKS
1243,1243,"                         Run, William! Run!"
1244,1244,               Will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws 
1245,1245,               Marion up onto its back. He slaps the horse's rump and it 
1246,1246,               plunges with Marion into the twisting village lanes. William 
1247,1247,"               darts off through the crowd, as the MAGISTRATE and more of "
1248,1248,               his soldiers arrive -- dozens of them!
1249,1249,"               William pauses out in the central street of the village, "
1250,1250,"               just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts "
1251,1251,               into a side lane in the opposite direction Marion went; 
1252,1252,               William weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval 
1253,1253,"               town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts."
1254,1254,"               As the soldiers stumble after him, the Magistrate looks down "
1255,1255,               at his mangled soldiers. The one with the ruptured arm is 
1256,1256,               lying in agony.
1257,1257,                                     MAGISTRATE
1258,1258,                         What happened?
1259,1259,                                     SOLDIER
1260,1260,                         ...girl.
1261,1261,                                     MAGISTRATE
1262,1262,                         What girl?!
1263,1263,                                     SOLDIER
1264,1264,                         ...on horse.
1265,1265,                                     MAGISTRATE
1266,1266,                         The girl on the horse! Stop her!
1267,1267,"               The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and "
1268,1268,               when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's 
1269,1269,"               trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even "
1270,1270,               narrower back alley. She sees a clear route to freedom...
1271,1271,               But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there 
1272,1272,               behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden 
1273,1273,"               thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall."
1274,1274,"               Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught "
1275,1275,"               on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward "
1276,1276,"               again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching "
1277,1277,"               and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard."
1278,1278,               WILLIAM
1279,1279,               reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the 
1280,1280,"               river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've "
1281,1281,"               lost him. Thinking Marion's made it too, William heads deeper "
1282,1282,               into the trees.
1283,1283,"               IN THE TOWN, MARION"
1284,1284,               recovers; her dress has torn free! She starts to get up; but 
1285,1285,"               the soldiers' pikes appear over her, and the magistrate leers."
1286,1286,                                     MAGISTRATE
1287,1287,                         So this is the little whore he was 
1288,1288,                         fighting for.
1289,1289,               
1290,1290, THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY
1291,1291,"               William moves into the shelters of the trees, expecting to "
1292,1292,               see Marion. He doesn't. He listens; only the rustling of the 
1293,1293,               wind through the treetops.
1294,1294,                                     WILLIAM
1295,1295,                         Marion!
1296,1296,"               Nothing, except the wind."
1297,1297,               
1298,1298, ROYAL MAGISTRATE'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY
1299,1299,               Marion is thrown into a chair and her arms are bound with an 
1300,1300,               oak staff behind her elbows. She and two dozen soldiers are 
1301,1301,               in the tavern the English have commandeered.
1302,1302,"               The Magistrate is a battlescarred veteran, a brutal pragmatist "
1303,1303,               angry with his CORPORAL.
1304,1304,                                     MAGISTRATE
1305,1305,                         One Scot buggers six of us? Hell to 
1306,1306,                         pay when that gets round.
1307,1307,                                     CORPORAL
1308,1308,                         Burn the village.
1309,1309,                                     MAGISTRATE
1310,1310,                         But he is free. You never catch 'em 
1311,1311,                         in the Highlands.
1312,1312,"               He studies Marion, her mouth now stuffed with burlap. He "
1313,1313,"               notices the strip of cloth around her neck, and touches the "
1314,1314,               weave curiously.
1315,1315,                                     CORPORAL
1316,1316,                         Clans weave that cloth in their own 
1317,1317,                         patterns.
1318,1318,                                     MAGISTRATE
1319,1319,                         So why is this strip concealed?
1320,1320,                              (beat)
1321,1321,"                         He fought for you, eh?"
1322,1322,               
1323,1323, TOWN SQUARE - DAY
1324,1324,               The Magistrate and his men bring Marion into the village 
1325,1325,"               center, and tie her to a post of the well. The townspeople "
1326,1326,"               don't want to be near the soldiers, but they hang on the "
1327,1327,"               fringes of the square, too curious to pull away."
1328,1328,                                     MAGISTRATE
1329,1329,                         An assault on the king's soldiers is 
1330,1330,                         the same as assaulting the king!
1331,1331,"               He looks down at Marion, her mouth bound, her eyes defiant."
1332,1332,               He jerks out his dagger and slices Marion's throat!
1333,1333,"               Her eyes spring open like a doe's; then she sags, dead. The "
1334,1334,               townspeople are speechless; even some of the soldiers are 
1335,1335,               shocked. The Magistrate turns calmly to his men.
1336,1336,                                     MAGISTRATE
1337,1337,                         Now. Let this scrapper come to me.
1338,1338,               LONG SHOT - 
1339,1339, THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY
1340,1340,"               From a distance, we see Hamish approaching the grove, the "
1341,1341,               same one where he and William played as boys. Hamish moves 
1342,1342,"               reluctantly, forcing himself forward; as he reaches the grove, "
1343,1343,"               William appears, hurrying out to him."
1344,1344,"               We STAY IN THE LONG SHOT, seeing William asking anxiously "
1345,1345,"               for any news, and seeing Hamish's great shoulders as he tells "
1346,1346,               him something that makes William step backwards...
1347,1347,               
1348,1348, LANARK VILLAGE - DAY
1349,1349,               At a barrier across the main road into the center of the 
1350,1350,"               village are twenty professional soldiers, entrenched, fully "
1351,1351,"               armed -- bows, pikes, swords. They hear A HORSE'S SNORT..."
1352,1352,"               THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS' POV - WALLACE, ON HIS HORSE"
1353,1353,"               He has stopped, rock still. The soldiers hush; there is "
1354,1354,"               something unsettling about this man alone, staring at the "
1355,1355,"               twenty of them, as if to steel himself for the butchery."
1356,1356,"               Wallace raises his sword, screams... and charges!"
1357,1357,               
1358,1358, VARIOUS ANGLES - LANARK VILLAGE - DAY - THE FIGHT
1359,1359,               We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse 
1360,1360,"               pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their "
1361,1361,               eyes white with fear... They stand to shoot at him with their 
1362,1362,"               bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past..."
1363,1363,"               The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch "
1364,1364,               his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as 
1365,1365,               Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's 
1366,1366,"               more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly "
1367,1367,               breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the 
1368,1368,"               corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!"
1369,1369,"               The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his "
1370,1370,               horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's 
1371,1371,               back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a 
1372,1372,               wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder 
1373,1373,               but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two 
1374,1374,               men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.
1375,1375,               WALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV
1376,1376,"               He dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts, "
1377,1377,               barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; 
1378,1378,"               the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next "
1379,1379,               chops down on his left side; every time he swings the 
1380,1380,"               broadsword, a man dies."
1381,1381,"               Wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from "
1382,1382,"               the village, follow in his wake."
1383,1383,               
1384,1384, IN THE VILLAGE - DAY
1385,1385,               The Magistrate hears the APPROACHING SHOUTS. He and thirty 
1386,1386,               more of his men are barricaded around the village square.
1387,1387,                                     MAGISTRATE
1388,1388,                         Don't look surprised! We knew he'd 
1389,1389,                         bring friends!
1390,1390,"               The see Wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads "
1391,1391,               down a side street.
1392,1392,               The Magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go?
1393,1393,"               Which way will he come from? And then they hear the horses, "
1394,1394,"               and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street. The "
1395,1395,               soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them.
1396,1396,               They are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on 
1397,1397,               foot! -- and cuts down two soldiers! The other Scots charge!
1398,1398,               The startled soldiers break and run in every direction.
1399,1399,"               The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too. Wallace pursues."
1400,1400,"               Not far along a twisting lane, the bulky Magistrate falters."
1401,1401,"               He turns to fight, and Wallace slashes away his sword."
1402,1402,                                     MAGISTRATE
1403,1403,                         No! I beg you... mercy!
1404,1404,               IN THE TOWN SQUARE
1405,1405,"               As the Scots see Wallace, they break off pursuing the English "
1406,1406,               soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the Magistrate by his 
1407,1407,"               hair, Wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams "
1408,1408,"               him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs "
1409,1409,"               and wild eyes, staring at Marion's murderer."
1410,1410,                                     MAGISTRATE
1411,1411,                         Please. Mercy!
1412,1412,"               Wallace's eyes shift, falling on"
1413,1413,               THE STAIN OF BLOOD
1414,1414,"               Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, "
1415,1415,               the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street. Wallace 
1416,1416,"               spins, jerks back the Magistrate's head, and cuts his throat "
1417,1417,               with the sword.
1418,1418,               ON THE OTHER SCOTS
1419,1419,               Silenced by what they've just seen and done. On old Campbell's 
1420,1420,"               face is a look of reverence, and awe."
1421,1421,                                     CAMPBELL
1422,1422,"                         Say Grace to God, lads. We've just "
1423,1423,                         seen the coming of the Messiah.
1424,1424,"               William staggers a few steps, and collapses to his knees."
1425,1425,               And then not just the Scottish farmers but the townspeople 
1426,1426,"               too begin a strange, Hi-Lo chant."
1427,1427,                                     CROWD
1428,1428,                         AHHHHHHH-UHHHHHH! AHHHHHH-UHHHHHH!
1429,1429,               William's wild eyes slowly regain their focus. And there in 
1430,1430,"               the dirt beside the well, he sees the severed cloth strip he "
1431,1431,"               gave to Marion, now stained with her blood. He lifts it, "
1432,1432,"               crushes it in his hand, as the Highlanders chant for war."
1433,1433,               
1434,1434, LANARK VILLAGE - NIGHT
1435,1435,               The villagers are still excited by what just happened; at 
1436,1436,"               the blacksmith's forge, men tend to Campbell's wound..."
1437,1437,                                     CAMPBELL
1438,1438,                         Pour it straight into the wound. I 
1439,1439,"                         know it seems a waste of good whiskey, "
1440,1440,                         but indulge me.
1441,1441,"               They obey, then take a glowing poker from the fire and run "
1442,1442,"               it through Campbell's shoulder, where the arrow went. There "
1443,1443,"               is a terrible SIZZLE, and Campbell reacts to the pain."
1444,1444,                                     CAMPBELL
1445,1445,"                         Ah. Now that'll clear your sinuses, "
1446,1446,                         lads.
1447,1447,               Campbell looks down at his left hand. His thumb is missing!
1448,1448,                                     CAMPBELL
1449,1449,"                         Well bloody Hell, look at this! Now "
1450,1450,                         it's nothing but a fly swatter.
1451,1451,"               Wallace is sitting alone nearby, staring at nothing. Hamish "
1452,1452,               moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder. Wallace looks at 
1453,1453,"               his friend, and looks away; killing the Magistrate did not "
1454,1454,               bring Marion back.
1455,1455,               SHOUTS of alarm: ARMED MEN are coming! The farmers scramble 
1456,1456,"               for their weapons, ready to fight; even Campbell jumps up; "
1457,1457,               but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more 
1458,1458,"               farmers, with hayhooks, knives, axes, anything they could "
1459,1459,               find for weapons. Their leader is MacGREGOR.
1460,1460,                                     CAMPBELL
1461,1461,                         MacGregor -- from the next valley!
1462,1462,               MacGregor leads his men into the circle of rebels.
1463,1463,                                     MACGREGOR
1464,1464,                         We heard about what was happenin'. 
1465,1465,                         And we don't want ya thinkin' ya can 
1466,1466,                         have your fun without us.
1467,1467,                                     WALLACE
1468,1468,"                         Go home. Some of us are in this, I "
1469,1469,                         can't help that now. But you can 
1470,1470,                         help yourselves. Go home.
1471,1471,                                     MACGREGOR
1472,1472,                         We'll have no homes left when the 
1473,1473,                         English garrison at the castle comes 
1474,1474,                         through to burn us out.
1475,1475,               They all look at Wallace.
1476,1476,               
1477,1477, ENGLISH MILITARY STRONGHOLD - NIGHT
1478,1478,"               Furious preparations: armorers pound breastplates, hone "
1479,1479,"               spears, grind swords in a shower of sparks. The garrison is "
1480,1480,"               led by BOTTOMS, the English lord who claimed the right of "
1481,1481,               prima noctes. Now he shouts to his scurrying soldiers.
1482,1482,                                     LORD BOTTOMS
1483,1483,                         Gather the horses! Align the infantry!
1484,1484,                              (grabs a man)
1485,1485,                         Ride to the Lord Governor in Stirling.
1486,1486,               Tell him that I will hang five rebels for every good 
1487,1487,               Englishman killed! FORM FOR MARCH!
1488,1488,               The troops begin to scramble into the courtyard. At the same 
1489,1489,"               time, the messenger gallops to the gate and nods for the "
1490,1490,               keepers to open it. They pull up the chains and the heavy 
1491,1491,               gate rises. The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- 
1492,1492,               and is hit in the chest with an axe!
1493,1493,"               The Scots, hidden just outside the gate, come pouring through, "
1494,1494,"               led by Wallace! Arrows pick soldiers from their perches, "
1495,1495,               Scots drop over the wall; the surprise is so complete that 
1496,1496,               it's over almost without a fight. Lord Bottoms looks around 
1497,1497,               in confusion...
1498,1498,                                     LORD BOTTOMS
1499,1499,                         Stop them... Don't let... Align...
1500,1500,               Scots drag Lord Bottoms off his horse; an arrow in a flexed 
1501,1501,"               bow jabs right up to his eye, the archer ready to drive the "
1502,1502,               shaft through Bottom's eye socket and into his brain; but 
1503,1503,               Wallace's hand closes on the archer's fingers -- and Bottoms 
1504,1504,               sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is 
1505,1505,               none other than the Highland farmgirl he forced into his bed 
1506,1506,"               on her wedding night. Beside her is her husband, holding a "
1507,1507,"               scythe, red with English blood."
1508,1508,                                     WALLACE
1509,1509,"                         On your way somewhere, M'lord?"
1510,1510,                                     LORD BOTTOMS
1511,1511,                         Murdering bloody bandit!
1512,1512,               The point of Wallace's sword jumps beneath the Lord's chin.
1513,1513,                                     WALLACE
1514,1514,                         My name is William Wallace. I am no 
1515,1515,                         bandit who hides his face... Find 
1516,1516,                         this man a horse.
1517,1517,               The green eyes of the defiled highland bride flash fire.
1518,1518,"               William takes his hand from her bow and looks at her, grief "
1519,1519,               for Marion in his eyes; for the sake of that she does not 
1520,1520,               release the string.
1521,1521,                                     WALLACE
1522,1522,                         Give him a horse.
1523,1523,               Hamish extends the reins of the Lord's thoroughbred.
1524,1524,                                     WALLACE
1525,1525,                         Not this horse. That one.
1526,1526,               He nods to a bony nag hitched next to a glue pot.
1527,1527,                                     WALLACE
1528,1528,"                         Today we will spare you, and every "
1529,1529,                         man who has yielded. Go back to 
1530,1530,                         England. Tell them Scotland's 
1531,1531,                         daughters and her sons are yours no 
1532,1532,                         more. Tell them Scotland is free.
1533,1533,"               As the Scots cheer, Wallace throws Lord Bottoms onto the "
1534,1534,"               nag's back and slaps the horse's rear. IT shambles away, "
1535,1535,"               followed by the English survivors, as the Scots chant..."
1536,1536,                                     SCOTS
1537,1537,"                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace, Wal-lace!..."
1538,1538,               CLOSE - A GRAVESTONE - 
1539,1539, HIGHLANDS - DAY
1540,1540,"               The marker is carved with the name MARION MacCLANNOUGH, and "
1541,1541,               beneath her name A THISTLE is chiseled into the stone.
1542,1542,               Bagpipes wail like banshees and the Priest who married Marion 
1543,1543,"               and William now mutters ancient prayers as her body, wrapped "
1544,1544,"               in burial canvas, is lowered into the earth, under the sad "
1545,1545,               eyes of those who just fought in the battle.
1546,1546,               Opposite William stands old MacClannough; he stares across 
1547,1547,"               the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter, his "
1548,1548,"               eyes full of pain, and then staggers away."
1549,1549,               Wallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief. From 
1550,1550,               within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief 
1551,1551,"               she gave him, and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave "
1552,1552,"               her. He places the strip over her heart, and as the "
1553,1553,               gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to 
1554,1554,               its spot over his own heart.
1555,1555,               
1556,1556, LONDON PALACE - DAY
1557,1557,"               Prince Edward is in his garden, playing the medieval version "
1558,1558,"               of croquet with his friend. The Princess, ignored, sits "
1559,1559,"               watching. Longshanks marches through the game, furious."
1560,1560,                                     LONGSHANKS
1561,1561,                         Scottish rebels have routed Lord 
1562,1562,                         Bottoms!
1563,1563,                                     EDWARD
1564,1564,"                         I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, "
1565,1565,                         nothing more.
1566,1566,"               Longshanks slaps his son, knocking him down among the colored "
1567,1567,"               balls and wickets. Everyone gasps, stunned."
1568,1568,                                     LONGSHANKS
1569,1569,                         You weak little coward! Stand up!
1570,1570,               Longshanks jerks him to his feet.
1571,1571,                                     LONGSHANKS
1572,1572,                         I go to France to press our rights 
1573,1573,                         there! I leave you to handle this 
1574,1574,"                         little rebellion, do you understand? "
1575,1575,                         DO YOU?!
1576,1576,               Longshanks grabs his son by the throat.
1577,1577,                                     LONGSHANKS
1578,1578,                         And turn yourself into a man.
1579,1579,               The king leaves. The friends of the humiliated Prince hurry 
1580,1580,               to him and lift him; as the Princess moves to him too...
1581,1581,                                     EDWARD
1582,1582,                         Get away from me!
1583,1583,"               He slaps her! Her personal guards, Frenchmen in distinctive "
1584,1584,"               uniforms, jump from their seats at the edge of the garden, "
1585,1585,               but the Princess raises a hand to show she needs no 
1586,1586,"               assistance, and curtseys to Edward, who shouts --"
1587,1587,                                     EDWARD
1588,1588,                         Convene my military council!
1589,1589,"               As Edward marches off with his entourage, NICOLETTE, a "
1590,1590,"               beautiful raven-haired Handmaiden, rushes to the Princess, "
1591,1591,"               who is wobbly, hurt more than she let show. Nicolette whispers "
1592,1592,"               to her in French, with subtitles..."
1593,1593,                                     NICOLETTE
1594,1594,                         They say this Wallace killed thirty 
1595,1595,                         men to avenge the death of his woman. 
1596,1596,                         I hope your husband goes to Scotland. 
1597,1597,                         Then you'll be a widow.
1598,1598,               
1599,1599, BRUCE'S CASTLE - BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
1600,1600,               Robert the Bruce is in bed with a young Nordic beauty with 
1601,1601,               vacant blue eyes. She drowses; but the lovemaking has not 
1602,1602,               defused the restlessness of Robert's spirit. He lies on his 
1603,1603,"               stomach, turned away from her on the bed. Stirring, she kisses "
1604,1604,               his neck; but he doesn't respond.
1605,1605,                                     WOMAN
1606,1606,                         I wanted to please you.
1607,1607,                                     ROBERT
1608,1608,                         You did.
1609,1609,"               But he is numb as she nuzzles him again. She sags back, and "
1610,1610,"               he still stares away, lost in thought. Realizing her hurt, "
1611,1611,               he explains...
1612,1612,                                     ROBERT
1613,1613,"                         In Lanark village, the king's soldiers "
1614,1614,                         killed a girl. Her lover fought his 
1615,1615,                         way through the soldiers and killed

1669,1669,"                         unless we are as ruthless, more "

1808,1808,"                         your guards, old man."
1809,1809,"               Wallace jerks his sword to the Irishman's throat, and grins."
1810,1810,                                     WALLACE
1811,1811,"                         That's my friend, Irishman. And the "
1812,1812,"                         answer's yes. You fight for me, you "
1813,1813,                         kill the English.
1814,1814,"               Stephen grins, and happily tucks away the dagger."
1815,1815,                                     STEPHEN
1816,1816,                         Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm 
1817,1817,                         the most wanted man on the Emerald 
1818,1818,                         Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald 
1819,1819,"                         Isle of course, more's the pity."
1820,1820,                                     HAMISH
1821,1821,                         A common thief.
1822,1822,                                     STEPHEN
1823,1823,                         A patriot!
1824,1824,"               Wallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire, as the "
1825,1825,               sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces.
1826,1826,               
1827,1827, SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
1828,1828,               A column of English light cavalry -- a hundred riders -- 
1829,1829,               moves through the picturesque beauty of the Highlands.
1830,1830,"               English LORD DOLECROFT is in command, wearing a hat with a "
1831,1831,"               pompous white plume. UP AHEAD, the English SCOUT sees five "
1832,1832,"               Scots, including Hamish, walking out of the forest. The Scots "
1833,1833,               run; the Scout rides back to Dolecroft.
1834,1834,                                     SCOUT
1835,1835,"                         Scotsmen, Sire! Headed west!"
1836,1836,                                     DOLECROFT
1837,1837,                         They've blundered at last! After 
1838,1838,                         them!
1839,1839,               The English force charges off. Hamish and his men changed 
1840,1840,               direction but the English spot them crossing a hilltop and 
1841,1841,               ride after them. The Scots run for their lives; the English 
1842,1842,"               horses gallop. The Scots run down one slope, up another; the "
1843,1843,"               English follow, find their horses stumbling, and see..."
1844,1844,                                     SCOUT
1845,1845,                         We're in a bog!
1846,1846,                                     DOLECROFT
1847,1847,"                         Here, it's firm this way --"
1848,1848,"               But as they move toward the firm ground, fifty Scots appear "
1849,1849,"               on the crest of the hill. Hamish leads them, smiling."
1850,1850,"               Dolecroft wheels and looks to his rear; Wallace appears there, "
1851,1851,"               with fifty more, and more Scots appear to the left and right "
1852,1852,"               of the English, who are surrounded in the bog. Too late, "
1853,1853,"               Dolecroft realizes his blunder. Wallace lifts his broadsword, "
1854,1854,"               screams, and leads the charge..."
1855,1855,               
1856,1856, SCOTTISH WOODS - DAY
1857,1857,               The Scots are moving through deep woods; they are laden with 
1858,1858,"               the booty they took from the English cavalry: extra weapons, "
1859,1859,"               clothing, food -- and one man even wears the late Dolecroft's "
1860,1860,"               plumed hat. Wallace is leading them, traveling with his heavy "
1861,1861,               sheathed broadsword across his shoulders.
1862,1862,                                     WALLACE
1863,1863,                         Stop here and rest.
1864,1864,"               They collapse to the leaves and loam, greedily squeezing "
1865,1865,               water from sheep belly canteens.
1866,1866,               
1867,1867, STIRLING CASTLE - DAY
1868,1868,"               LORD PICKERING, English commander, is handed news of the "
1869,1869,"               disaster. He reads the message, and pales."
1870,1870,                                     PICKERING
1871,1871,                         Another ambush! My God! ...What about 
1872,1872,                         our infiltrator?
1873,1873,                                     ASSISTANT
1874,1874,"                         He has already joined them, M'lord."
1875,1875,               
1876,1876, SCOTTISH WOODS - NIGHT
1877,1877,"               The moon is high above the Scots, encamped for the night."
1878,1878,"               Most everyone is sleeping, but William sits leaning against "
1879,1879,"               a tree, lost in lonely thoughts. Suddenly William freezes; a "
1880,1880,               shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty 
1881,1881,               feet ahead of him. Something about her is familiar -- and 
1882,1882,"               then she pulls off the hood, revealing her auburn hair, "
1883,1883,               cascading in the moonlight... It is Marion!
1884,1884,                                     WALLACE
1885,1885,                         Marion! Is... is it you?
1886,1886,"               Joy explodes on his face, and he runs to her, but stops before "
1887,1887,"               he touches her, as if she might evaporate."
1888,1888,                                     WALLACE
1889,1889,                         I'm dreaming.
1890,1890,                                     MARION
1891,1891,"                         Yes, you are. And you must wake."
1892,1892,                                     WALLACE
1893,1893,                         I don't want to wake. I want to stay 
1894,1894,                         with you.
1895,1895,                                     MARION
1896,1896,                         And I with you. But you must wake.
1897,1897,                                     WALLACE
1898,1898,                         I need you so much! I love you!
1899,1899,                                     MARION
1900,1900,"                         Wake up, William. Wake up!"
1901,1901,                                     HAMISH'S VOICE
1902,1902,"                         Wake up, William!..."
1903,1903,                                     MARION/HAMISH
1904,1904,                         Wake up!...
1905,1905,"               William clutches at Marion, but his arms can't enclose her."
1906,1906,               HE WAKES
1907,1907,"               lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, "
1908,1908,               William's arms clutched empty to his chest.
1909,1909,                                     HAMISH
1910,1910,                         William! Hounds!
1911,1911,"               Wallace jumps up, hearing the DISTANT BARKING that alarmed "
1912,1912,"               Hamish. Stephen, the new Irish recruit, races up."
1913,1913,                                     STEPHEN
1914,1914,                         We must run in different directions!
1915,1915,                                     HAMISH
1916,1916,                         We don't split up!
1917,1917,                                     STEPHEN
1918,1918,"                         They used hounds on us in Ireland, "
1919,1919,                         it's the only way!
1920,1920,                                     WALLACE
1921,1921,"                         He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide "
1922,1922,                         them and run!
1923,1923,"               Shoving groups of men in different directions, Wallace then "
1924,1924,               takes off. His group is about a dozen; they race through the 
1925,1925,"               woods, dodging trees, running aimlessly. They stop and listen. "
1926,1926,               The BARKS are getting closer.
1927,1927,                                     WALLACE
1928,1928,                         Split again!
1929,1929,"               Again they divide, and race in different directions."
1930,1930,"               But no matter how they run and dodge, the BARKS grow nearer."
1931,1931,               We 
1932,1932,RCUT with the approaching of the dogs -- a large PACK 
1933,1933,"               OF HOUNDS, with keepers like on a fox hunt, and behind the "
1934,1934,"               dogs, Lord Pickering, with his soldiers, prepared for a long "
1935,1935,"               chase, cloaked against the wet darkness, carrying torches."
1936,1936,"               Wallace and others pause, hear the dogs, and run again, in a "
1937,1937,               new direction. The hounds are relentless. Wallace's group is 
1938,1938,"               down to Hamish, Stephen, and Faudron."
1939,1939,                                     WALLACE
1940,1940,"                         No matter how we go, they follow. "
1941,1941,                         They have our scent. My scent.
1942,1942,                                     FAUDRON
1943,1943,                         Run! You must not be caught!
1944,1944,"               Faster now, faster. The barks are getting very close."
1945,1945,               Wallace and his friends are starting to panic. The blood 
1946,1946,"               beats in their ears, their breath scalds their lungs. And we "
1947,1947,"               MOVE IN on Wallace's eyes. He stops, gasping."
1948,1948,                                     STEPHEN
1949,1949,                         We can't stop!
1950,1950,                                     WALLACE
1951,1951,                         They've tricked us.
1952,1952,                                     STEPHEN
1953,1953,"                         What's the crazy man saying, Lord?"
1954,1954,                                     WALLACE
1955,1955,                         The dogs have a scent. My scent. 
1956,1956,                         Someone must have given it to them.
1957,1957,                                     STEPHEN
1958,1958,                         Who would do such a thing?
1959,1959,                                     WALLACE
1960,1960,                         Exactly.
1961,1961,               Wallace pulls out his dagger...
1962,1962,               THE DOGS
1963,1963,               bark frantically now; they smell a kill; they tug so hard at 
1964,1964,               their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along.
1965,1965,                                     HANDLER
1966,1966,                         Be ready! We have them!
1967,1967,"               The soldiers grip their weapons, ready to take their "
1968,1968,               prisoners. They burst into the little clearing; the dogs 
1969,1969,"               find a body, stabbed, his throat cut; the dogs plunge their "
1970,1970,"               snouts into the gore, yipping wildly. The handlers must fight "
1971,1971,               furiously to tear the dogs from the body.
1972,1972,               Lord Pickering approaches the body and looks down. It is 
1973,1973,"               Faudron, mangled now but clearly identifiable -- with the "
1974,1974,"               scarf he gave William, in place of William's own, tucked "
1975,1975,               into his shirt.
1976,1976,                                     LORD PICKERING
1977,1977,                         Damnation! Damnation!
1978,1978,"               As Pickering rants, his men look at the darkness all around."
1979,1979,                                     LORD PICKERING
1980,1980,                         After him! Get them going again!
1981,1981,                                     HANDLER
1982,1982,"                         Their noses are drowned in new blood, "
1983,1983,                         they'll follow nothing now!
1984,1984,               And just as the realization hits Pickering that he can't 
1985,1985,"               pursue Wallace any further, a cloaked figure mixed in among "
1986,1986,               his men leans in from behind him to whisper...
1987,1987,                                     STEPHEN OF IRELAND
1988,1988,                         The Almighty says for you to give 
1989,1989,                         His regards to the Devil.
1990,1990,"               Pickering's eyes go wide, then roll back as Stephen's dagger "
1991,1991,               slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart. As 
1992,1992,"               Pickering falls and his men realize what has happened, Stephen "
1993,1993,               has already run back into the trees.
1994,1994,               Pickering's men freeze at this sudden turn of events. Even 
1995,1995,"               the dogs whimper, picking up the rising fear of the men around "
1996,1996,               them. Then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus 
1997,1997,"               of demonic, bloodcurdling yells --"

1999,1999,                         ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH!
2000,2000,               Three wild men tear out of the darkness from different 
2001,2001,"               directions, their swords slashing. Pickering's men panic and "
2002,2002,"               run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by "
2003,2003,"               their torches, fell with them in all directions."
2004,2004,"               Wallace, Hamish and Stephen are left alone in the heart of "
2005,2005,"               the woods, howling, barking like dogs, snarling like wolves -- "
2006,2006,               and then laughing like hyenas!
2007,2007,                                     STEPHEN
2008,2008,                         I thought I was dead when ya pulled 
2009,2009,                         that dagger!
2010,2010,                                     WALLACE
2011,2011,                         No English lord would trust an 
2012,2012,                         Irishman!
2013,2013,                                     HAMISH
2014,2014,                         Let's kill him anyway.
2015,2015,"               They laugh again; then Wallace's laughter leaks away, and he "
2016,2016,"               stares into the trees, where he saw Marion in his dream."

2101,2101,"               At a crossroads, more of Wallace's men join them, in clusters. "
2102,2102,"               One group carries something long, encased in wool covers. "
2103,2103,"               Farmers in the field, blacksmiths at their forges, leave "

2105,2105,"               the riders. They put on their forbidden tartans, kiss their "

2108,2108, STIRLING FIELD - DAY
2109,2109,"               Stirling Castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field, "
2110,2110,"               cut in half by a river, spanned by an old wooden bridge."
2111,2111,               SCOTTISH NOBLES have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking 
2112,2112,"               the field; they wear gleaming armor, with plumes, sashes and "
2113,2113,"               banners, and are attended by squires and grooms."
2114,2114,               The mists of morning shroud most of the field. But from the 
2115,2115,               opposite side of the bridge they hear the CLATTERING of a 
2116,2116,"               huge army moving forward. LOCHLAN, a noble, gallops to Mornay."
2117,2117,                                     LOCHLAN
2118,2118,                         It sounds like twenty thousand!

2120,2120,                         The scouts say it is ten.

2122,2122,                         And we have but two!
2123,2123,               THE COMMON SCOTTISH SOLDIERS
2124,2124,"               are wearing padded leather shirts, and carry pikes and "
2125,2125,               daggers. As through the mists they see the numbers arrayed 
2126,2126,"               against them, a YOUNG SOLDIER tugs at a grizzled VETERAN."
2127,2127,                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
2128,2128,                         So many!

2130,2130,                         The nobles will negotiate. If they 
2131,2131,"                         deal, they send us home. If not, we "
2132,2132,                         charge. When we are all dead and 
2133,2133,"                         they can call themselves brave, they "
2134,2134,                         withdraw.
2135,2135,                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
2136,2136,                         I didn't come to fight so they could 
2137,2137,                         own more lands that I could work for 
2138,2138,                         them!
2139,2139,                                     VETERAN
2140,2140,                         Nor did I. Not against these odds!
2141,2141,               He lowers his pike and starts to desert. At first one-by-one 
2142,2142,"               and then in clumps, more highlanders follow."
2143,2143,               THE NOBLES see the desertion.
2144,2144,                                     LOCHLAN
2145,2145,                         Stop! Men! Do not flee! Not now! 
2146,2146,                         Wait until we have negotiated!
2147,2147,                                     MORNAY
2148,2148,                         They won't stop -- and who could 
2149,2149,                         blame them?
2150,2150,"               Then, riding into the mob of men, comes Wallace, followed by "
2151,2151,"               his friends. He's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms "
2152,2152,"               bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather "
2153,2153,"               shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, "
2154,2154,"               Wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it."
2155,2155,               The entire Scottish army watches in fascination as Wallace 
2156,2156,"               and his men ride through them, toward the command hill. The "
2157,2157,               soldiers whisper among themselves...

2161,2161,                         Couldn't be.
2162,2162,"               The common soldiers, already having broken ranks, cluster up "
2163,2163,               the hill to see the confrontation. As Wallace and his captains 
2164,2164,"               reach the nobles, Stephen laughs."

2167,2167,"                         fashionable fight, it's drawn the "
2168,2168,                         finest people.
2169,2169,                                     LOCHLAN
2170,2170,                         Where is thy salute?
2171,2171,                                     WALLACE
2172,2172,                         For presenting yourselves on this 
2173,2173,"                         battlefield, I give you thanks."
2174,2174,                                     LOCHLAN
2175,2175,"                         This is our army. To join it, you "
2176,2176,                         give homage.
2177,2177,                                     WALLACE
2178,2178,                         I give homage to Scotland. And if 
2179,2179,"                         this is your army, why does it go?"
2180,2180,               Wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen 
2181,2181,"               men, now frightened, ready to desert. We play this picture, "
2182,2182,"               Wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing "
2183,2183,               that has grown beyond anyone's imagination.
2184,2184,"               He glances at his friends: Campbell, Hamish, Stephen."
2185,2185,"               They've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is."
2186,2186,                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN
2187,2187,                         We didn't come to fight for them!
2188,2188,                                     SHOUTS FROM MOB
2189,2189,                         Home! The English are too many!
2190,2190,"               Wallace raises his hand, and the army falls silent."
2191,2191,                                     WALLACE
2192,2192,                         Sons of Scotland!... I am William 
2193,2193,                         Wallace!
2194,2194,                                     SOLDIER
2195,2195,                         William Wallace is seven feet tall!
2196,2196,                                     WALLACE
2197,2197,"                         Yes, I have heard! He kills men by "
2198,2198,"                         the hundreds! And if he were here, "
2199,2199,                         he would consume the English with 
2200,2200,"                         fireballs from his eyes, and bolts "
2201,2201,                         of lightning from his ass!
2202,2202,               Many laugh -- all get the point.
2203,2203,                                     WALLACE
2204,2204,                         I am William Wallace. And my enemies 
2205,2205,                         do not go away. I saw our good nobles 
2206,2206,                         hanged. My wife... I am William 
2207,2207,                         Wallace. And I see a whole army of 
2208,2208,"                         my countrymen, here in defiance of "
2209,2209,                         tyranny. You have come to fight as 
2210,2210,                         free men. And free men you are! What 
2211,2211,                         will you do with freedom? Will you 
2212,2212,                         fight?

2216,2216,                                     WALLACE
2217,2217,                         Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and 
2218,2218,"                         you will live, at least awhile. And "
2219,2219,                         dying in your bed many years from 
2220,2220,"                         now, would you be willing to trade "
2221,2221,"                         all the days from this day to that, "
2222,2222,                         for one chance to come back here as 
2223,2223,"                         young men, and tell our enemies that "
2224,2224,"                         they make take our lives, but they "
2225,2225,                         will never take our freedom?
2226,2226,"               Down on the plain, English emissaries in all their regal "
2227,2227,"               finery gallop over the bridge, under a banner of truce."
2228,2228,                                     VETERAN
2229,2229,                         Look! The English comes to barter 
2230,2230,                         with our nobles for castles and 
2231,2231,                         titles. And our nobles will not be 
2232,2232,                         in the front of the battle!
2233,2233,                                     WALLACE
2234,2234,                         No! They will not!
2235,2235,"               He dismounts, and draws his sword."
2236,2236,                                     WALLACE
2237,2237,                         And I will.
2238,2238,"               Slowly, the chant begins, and builds..."

2241,2241,"               BAGPIPERS play, pulling the mob back into companies. But "
2242,2242,               through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy

2245,2245,                         Fine speech. Now what do we do?
2246,2246,                                     WALLACE
2247,2247,                         Bring out our spearmen and set them 
2248,2248,                         in the field.
2249,2249,"               Campbell, Hamish and Stephen ride off. Mornay reins his horse "
2250,2250,"               over, lifts the reins of Wallace's horse, and extends them "
2251,2251,               to him: an invitation to join the pre-battle talks.
2252,2252,               Wallace mounts up and rides out with the Scottish nobles to 
2253,2253,               meet the English contingent.
2254,2254,"               OUT ON THE FIELD, THE TWO GROUPS OF RIDERS"

2260,2260,                         Cheltham. This is William Wallace
2261,2261,                                     CHELTHAM
2262,2262,                         Here are the King's terms. Lead this 
2263,2263,"                         army off the field, and he will give "
2264,2264,"                         you each estates in Yorkshire, "
2265,2265,"                         including hereditary title, from "
2266,2266,                         which you will pay him an annual --

2268,2268,                         I have an offer for you.

2275,2275,                         You disrespect a banner of truce?!
2276,2276,                                     WALLACE
2277,2277,                         From his king? Absolutely. Here are 
2278,2278,                         Scotland's terms. Lower your flags 
2279,2279,"                         and march straight to England, "

2282,2282,"                         years of theft, rape, and murder. Do "
2283,2283,"                         that, and your men shall live. Do it "
2284,2284,"                         not, and every one of you will die "
2285,2285,                         today.
2286,2286,               Cheltham barks at the Scottish nobles...
2287,2287,                                     CHELTHAM
2288,2288,                         You are outmatched! You haven't even 
2289,2289,                         any cavalry! In two centuries no 
2290,2290,                         army has won without it!
2291,2291,                                     WALLACE
2292,2292,                         I'm not finished. Before we let you 
2293,2293,"                         leave, your commander must cross "
2294,2294,"                         that bridge, stand before this army, "
2295,2295,"                         put his head between his legs, and "
2296,2296,                         kiss his own ass.
2297,2297,               The outraged Englishman gallops back to his lines.
2298,2298,                                     MORNAY
2299,2299,                         I'd say that was rather less cordial 
2300,2300,                         that he was used to.
2301,2301,                                     WALLACE
2302,2302,"                         Be ready, and do exactly as I say."
2303,2303,               They return to the Scottish lines. Wallace dismounts where 
2304,2304,"               his men are breaking out new 14-foot spears. Hamish, eyebrows "
2305,2305,"               raised, looks expectantly at Wallace; Wallace nods."
2306,2306,                                     HAMISH
2307,2307,                         Wish I could see the noble lord's 
2308,2308,                         face when he tells him.
2309,2309,"               LORD TALMADGE, AT HIS COMMAND POST"
2310,2310,               The husky English commander's blood boils from Cheltham's 
2311,2311,"               report. Before he can respond, they see WALLACE'S SPEARMEN "
2312,2312,               taking up a position on the far side of the bridge. Suddenly 
2313,2313,               the Scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the English!
2314,2314,                                     TALMADGE
2315,2315,                         Insolent bastard! Full attack! Give 
2316,2316,                         no quarter! And I want this Wallace's 
2317,2317,                         heart brought to me on a plate!
2318,2318,               Cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack...
2319,2319,               
2320,2320, THE FIELD BELOW STIRLING CASTLE - DAY
2321,2321,               The English army moves forward toward the bridge. It's so 
2322,2322,               narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it 
2323,2323,"               at any one time. The English heavy cavalry, two hundred "
2324,2324,"               knights, cross uncontested, and form up on the other side."
2325,2325,               WITH WALLACE AND THE SCOTS
2326,2326,               Things look terrible. Stephen turns to William.
2327,2327,                                     STEPHEN
2328,2328,                         The Lord tell me He can get me out 
2329,2329,                         of this mess. But He's pretty sure 
2330,2330,                         you're fooked.
2331,2331,               ON THE ENGLISH SIDE
2332,2332,               Talmadge sees the Scots doing nothing.
2333,2333,                                     TALMADGE
2334,2334,                         Amateurs! They do not even contest 
2335,2335,                         us! Send across the infantry.
2336,2336,                                     GENERAL
2337,2337,"                         M'lord, the bridge is so narrow --"
2338,2338,                                     TALMADGE
2339,2339,                         The Scots just stand in their 
2340,2340,                         formations!
2341,2341,               Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Get the infantry 
2342,2342,               across so they can finish the slaughter!
2343,2343,               The English leaders shout orders and keep their men moving 
2344,2344,               across the bridge. Talmadge gestures for the attack flag.
2345,2345,               THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
2346,2346,"               The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to "
2347,2347,"               attack. They take the lances from their squires, and lower "
2348,2348,"               the visors of their helmets. Proud, plumed, glimmering; they "
2349,2349,"               look invincible. Their huge horses, themselves draped in "
2350,2350,"               scarlet and purple, look like tanks. The knights charge!"
2351,2351,               Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground 
2352,2352,               literally shakes with the charge.
2353,2353,               The Scots stand and watch them come on. It's difficult to 
2354,2354,               imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH 
2355,2355,               LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the 
2356,2356,"               RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer..."
2357,2357,               Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots.
2358,2358,                                     WALLACE
2359,2359,                         Steady! Hold... hold... NOW!
2360,2360,               The Scots snap their 14-foot spears straight up in unison.
2361,2361,                                     WALLACE
2362,2362,                         FORM!
2363,2363,"               Now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first "
2364,2364,               line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above 
2365,2365,"               the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five "
2366,2366,"               foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet."
2367,2367,               The English knights have never seen such a formation. Their 
2368,2368,               lances are useless and it's too late to stop! The momentum 
2369,2369,               that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on 
2370,2370,               foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale 
2371,2371,               themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.
2372,2372,               TALMADGE
2373,2373,"               can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN "
2374,2374,"               AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield."
2375,2375,               WALLACE AND HIS MEN
2376,2376,"               are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and "
2377,2377,               knights. Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen 
2378,2378,"               out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still "
2379,2379,               alive. Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull 
2380,2380,               up their mounts. Wallace and his men are so much more mobile 
2381,2381,               than the knights; the field runs with blood.
2382,2382,               Wallace faces Talmadge in the distance.
2383,2383,                                     WALLACE
2384,2384,"                         Here I am, English coward! Come get "
2385,2385,                         me!!
2386,2386,               TALMADGE is even more enraged -- and his judgment is gone.
2387,2387,                                     TALMADGE
2388,2388,                         Press the men across!
2389,2389,                                     CHELTHAM
2390,2390,                         But M'lord!
2391,2391,               Talmadge himself gallops forward.
2392,2392,                                     TALMADGE
2393,2393,                         PRESS THEM!
2394,2394,               WALLACE smiles. He grabs Hamish.
2395,2395,                                     WALLACE
2396,2396,                         Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and 
2397,2397,                         cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be 
2398,2398,                         sure the English see him ride away!
2399,2399,               Hamish hurries off with the message.
2400,2400,               The English infantry keeps moving across the little bridge.
2401,2401,               The Scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback.
2402,2402,"               They have a few dozen mounted riders, none heavily armored."
2403,2403,                                     LOCHLAN
2404,2404,                         If he waits much longer --
2405,2405,               Hamish hurries up.
2406,2406,                                     HAMISH
2407,2407,                         Ride around and ford behind them!
2408,2408,                                     MORNAY
2409,2409,                         We should not divide our forces!
2410,2410,                                     HAMISH
2411,2411,                         Wallace says do it! And he says for 
2412,2412,                         you to let the English see you!
2413,2413,                                     MORNAY
2414,2414,                              (understanding)
2415,2415,                         They shall think we run away.
2416,2416,               Mornay leads his riders away.
2417,2417,               LORD TALMADGE
2418,2418,"               sees the Scottish nobles ride off, and shouts to Cheltham..."
2419,2419,                                     TALMADGE
2420,2420,                         See! Every Scot with a horse is 
2421,2421,                         fleeing! Hurry! Hurry!
2422,2422,               He drives half his army across the river.
2423,2423,               WALLACE
2424,2424,               lifts his sword.
2425,2425,                                     WALLACE
2426,2426,                         For Scotland!
2427,2427,               He charges down the hill...
2428,2428,               THE FIGHT AT STIRLING BRIDGE - VARIOUS SHOTS
2429,2429,"               The Scots follow Wallace on foot, charging into the English."
2430,2430,               The English leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack.
2431,2431,                                     TALMADGE
2432,2432,                         Press reinforcements across!
2433,2433,               The English leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers 
2434,2434,"               onto the bridge, which only hams them up. Meanwhile, on the "
2435,2435,"               other side of the bridge, Wallace and his charging men slam "
2436,2436,               into the English infantry with wild fury. The English fall 
2437,2437,"               back on each other, further blocking the bridge."
2438,2438,               UP ON THE HILLTOP
2439,2439,               The nobles look back with grudging admiration.
2440,2440,                                     MORNAY
2441,2441,                         He's taking the bloody bridge! The 
2442,2442,                         English can't get across! He's evened 
2443,2443,                         the odds at one stroke!
2444,2444,"               With rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur..."
2445,2445,"               DOWN ON THE PLAIN, Wallace and the attacking men drive the "
2446,2446,"               English back, killing as they go. The Scots reach the bridge "
2447,2447,               itself. The waters below it run red with blood.
2448,2448,               Talmadge has begun to panic.
2449,2449,                                     TALMADGE
2450,2450,                         Use the archers!
2451,2451,                                     GENERAL
2452,2452,"                         They're too close, we'll shoot out "
2453,2453,                         own men!
2454,2454,               ON THE BRIDGE
2455,2455,               the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; 
2456,2456,               nothing can stop them. Wallace is relentless; each time he 
2457,2457,"               swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight "
2458,2458,"               beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old "
2459,2459,               Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English 
2460,2460,"               swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but "
2461,2461,"               Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs "
2462,2462,"               him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin "
2463,2463,               to build a barrier with the dead bodies.
2464,2464,               The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a 
2465,2465,               desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable 
2466,2466,               barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; 
2467,2467,"               Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, "
2468,2468,"               his hair, and his brain."
2469,2469,               TALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining 
2470,2470,               English General tries to save the army.
2471,2471,                                     GENERAL
2472,2472,                         We are still five thousand! Rally!
2473,2473,"               The English try to form up; but the Scottish horsemen, fording "
2474,2474,"               the river high upstream, come crashing into the English flank "
2475,2475,               and ride over the surprised English infantry.
2476,2476,"               AT THE BRIDGE, WALLACE"
2477,2477,               sees the Scottish nobles attacking. The English soldiers are 
2478,2478,"               in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides."
2479,2479,               And the Scottish soldiers taste something Scots have not 
2480,2480,               tasted for a hundred years: victory. Even while finishing 
2481,2481,"               off the last of the English soldiers, they begin their highlow "
2482,2482,               chant... Even the noblemen take up the chant!
2483,2483,               Wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies 
2484,2484,               on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on 
2485,2485,               the bridge; the bridge slick with blood.
2486,2486,"               Before it can all sink in, William is lifted on the shoulders "
2487,2487,               of his men.
2488,2488,                                     SCOTTISH SOLDIERS
2489,2489,                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!
2490,2490,               
2491,2491, CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY
2492,2492,"               William kneels before one of Scotland's ancient elders, who "
2493,2493,               lifts a silver sword and dubs William's shoulders.
2494,2494,                                     ELDER
2495,2495,                         I knight thee Sir William Wallace.
2496,2496,"               William rises and faces the Great Hall, crowded with hundreds "
2497,2497,"               of new admirers, as well as his old friends in their new "
2498,2498,               clothes and armor. The crowd chants --
2499,2499,                                     CROWD
2500,2500,"                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace!!"
2501,2501,"               Wallace lifts his eyes, taking it all in. At the rear of the "
2502,2502,"               hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained "
2503,2503,"               glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he "
2504,2504,"               sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment "
2505,2505,"               of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a "
2506,2506,               gown worthy of the occasion. But the illusion won't last; in 
2507,2507,"               the blink of an eye she is gone, and Wallace hears the chant, "
2508,2508,               and fingers the cloth she gave him.
2509,2509,               
2510,2510, SCOTTISH COUNCIL - DAY
2511,2511,               The nobles of Scotland are gathered in the huge chamber; a 
2512,2512,"               massive table runs across the far end of the room, and aligned "
2513,2513,"               on either side are the two rival factions of nobles, glaring "
2514,2514,"               at each other. Old Craig is in the center, with young Robert "
2515,2515,               the Bruce on his right. There is a general MURMUR along the 
2516,2516,"               nobles, and Robert whispers to Craig..."
2517,2517,                                     ROBERT
2518,2518,                         Does anyone know his politics?
2519,2519,                                     CRAIG
2520,2520,                         No. But his weight with the commoners 
2521,2521,                         could unbalance everything. The 
2522,2522,"                         Balliols will kiss his ass, so we "
2523,2523,                         must.
2524,2524,               A court STEWARDS steps in and formally announces...
2525,2525,                                     STEWARD
2526,2526,                         Lords of Scotland: Sir William 
2527,2527,                         Wallace!
2528,2528,               The nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other 
2529,2529,"               in their acclamation as Wallace strides in, flanked by Hamish, "
2530,2530,"               Campbell, and Stephen, splendid in their tartans."
2531,2531,               Old Craig rises.
2532,2532,                                     CRAIG
2533,2533,"                         Sir William. In the name of God, we "
2534,2534,                         declare and appoint thee High 
2535,2535,                         Protector of Scotland! And thy 
2536,2536,                         captains as aides decamp!
2537,2537,               The nobles rise; court attendants hurry to Wallace and drape 
2538,2538,               a golden chain of office around his neck. Wallace takes the 
2539,2539,               three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the 
2540,2540,"               necks of his friends, as once again the nobles applaud."
2541,2541,"               Almost before the applause dies, a member of the BALLIOL "
2542,2542,"               clan, who has kept an open seat beside him, speaks up..."
2543,2543,                                     BALLIOL
2544,2544,                         Sir William!! Inasmuch as you and 
2545,2545,                         your captains hail from a region 
2546,2546,                         long known to support the Balliol 
2547,2547,"                         clan, may we invite you to join us?"
2548,2548,"               But Wallace's gaze has locked onto Robert the Bruce, who "
2549,2549,"               stares back, the two young lions instantly recognizing the "
2550,2550,               leadership power of each other.
2551,2551,                                     WALLACE
2552,2552,                         You are Robert the Bruce.
2553,2553,                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
2554,2554,                         I am.
2555,2555,                                     WALLACE
2556,2556,                         My father fought in support of yours.
2557,2557,               The Balliols shrivel. The nobles on the Bruce side can barely 
2558,2558,               keep from grinning. Suddenly the men on the other end of the 
2559,2559,               table change their attack.
2560,2560,                                     BALLIOL
2561,2561,"                         With this new success, the result of "
2562,2562,"                         all of Scotland's efforts, now is "
2563,2563,                         the time to declare a king!
2564,2564,                                     MORNAY
2565,2565,                         Then you are prepared to recognize 
2566,2566,                         our legitimate succession!
2567,2567,                                     BALLIOL
2568,2568,                         You're the ones who won't support 
2569,2569,                         the true claim! I demand consideration 
2570,2570,                         of these documents!
2571,2571,"               Wallace glances again at the Bruce, who suddenly feels ashamed "
2572,2572,               of the bickering.
2573,2573,                                     MORNAY
2574,2574,                         Those were lies when they were 
2575,2575,                         written! Our documents prove 
2576,2576,                         absolutely that --
2577,2577,               Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.
2578,2578,                                     CRAIG
2579,2579,                         Sir William! Where are you going?
2580,2580,                                     WILLIAM
2581,2581,                         We have beaten the English! But 
2582,2582,"                         they'll come back, because you won't "
2583,2583,                         stand together. There is one clan in 
2584,2584,                         this country -- Scotsmen. One class -- 
2585,2585,                         free. One price -- courage.
2586,2586,               He turns again and strides toward the door.
2587,2587,                                     CRAIG
2588,2588,                         But... what will you do?
2589,2589,                                     WALLACE
2590,2590,                         I will invade England. And defeat 
2591,2591,                         the English on their own ground.
2592,2592,                                     CRAIG
2593,2593,"                         Invade?! That's impossible, it --"
2594,2594,               Wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length 
2595,2595,"               of the table, bashing the succession documents into the laps "
2596,2596,               of the nobles.
2597,2597,                                     WALLACE
2598,2598,                         LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands 
2599,2599,                         this! This!
2600,2600,               He brandishes the broadsword.
2601,2601,                                     WALLACE
2602,2602,                         There is a difference between us. 
2603,2603,                         You think the people of this country 
2604,2604,                         exist to provide you with position. 
2605,2605,                         I think your position exists to 
2606,2606,                         provide the people with freedom. And 
2607,2607,                         I go to make sure they have it.
2608,2608,"               Wallace bangs through the door. Suppressing smiles, his "
2609,2609,               friends file out behind him.
2610,2610,               
2611,2611, EDINBURGH CORRIDOR - DAY
2612,2612,"               Wallace and his men are marching away, as Robert the Bruce "
2613,2613,               runs out after them.
2614,2614,                                     ROBERT
2615,2615,                         Wait! ...I respect what you said. 
2616,2616,"                         But remember, these men have lands, "
2617,2617,                         castles. Much to risk.
2618,2618,                                     WALLACE
2619,2619,                         And the common man who bleeds on the 
2620,2620,"                         battlefield, does he risk less?"
2621,2621,                                     ROBERT
2622,2622,                         No. But from top to bottom this 
2623,2623,                         country has no sense of itself. Its 
2624,2624,                         nobles share allegiance with England 
2625,2625,                         and its clans war with each other. 
2626,2626,                         If you make enemies on both sides of 
2627,2627,"                         the border, you'll end up dead."
2628,2628,                                     WALLACE
2629,2629,                         We all end up dead. It's only a 
2630,2630,                         question of how. And why.
2631,2631,               Wallace walks; Robert catches up and speaks to him in an 
2632,2632,"               urgent half whisper, so that no one else can hear."
2633,2633,                                     ROBERT
2634,2634,                         I'm no coward! I want what you want! 
2635,2635,                         But we need the nobles.
2636,2636,                                     WALLACE
2637,2637,                         Nobles? What does that mean -- to be 
2638,2638,                         noble? Your title gives you claim to 
2639,2639,                         the throne of our country. But men 
2640,2640,"                         don't follow titles, they follow "
2641,2641,                         courage! Your arm speaks louder than 
2642,2642,                         your tongue. Our people know you. 
2643,2643,"                         Noble and common, they respect you. "
2644,2644,"                         If you would lead them toward freedom, "
2645,2645,                         they would follow you. And so would 
2646,2646,                         I.
2647,2647,"               Wallace walks away, leaving Robert the Bruce alone."

2650,2650,"               countryside of northern England. It is autumn, the foliage "
2651,2651,"               is beautiful, the wheat fields gold with harvest."

2666,2666,                         begging for help! Where will Wallace

2689,2689,               The governor is furious and confused.
2690,2690,                                     GOVERNOR
2691,2691,                         We will not allow a bandit to panic 
2692,2692,                         the greatest city in Northern England! 
2693,2693,                         Close off the escapes! Let no one

2697,2697,                         Only the Scottish civilians remain.
2698,2698,               The Governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his 
2699,2699,"               uncle, Longshanks the King."
2700,2700,               ON THE BATTERING RAM
2701,2701,               as it picks up speed and SLAMS into the wooden gate of the 
2702,2702,"               city. With the collision, THE BATTLE IS ON. It's a night "
2703,2703,"               battle: torches, flaming arrows, pots of boiling oil being "
2704,2704,"               splashed down at the attackers, who swarm the gate."
2705,2705,"               The oil beats the first wave of Scots back, but Wallace rushes "
2706,2706,"               forward, grabbing the ram cart with his own hands; the "
2707,2707,"               attackers rally to him, helping him slam the gate again and "
2708,2708,"               again. It breaks; but behind it is an awful tangle of carts, "
2709,2709,"               broken sheds, impenetrable rubbish. Wallace grabs a torch, "
2710,2710,"               throws it into the wooden tangle, and shouts --"
2711,2711,                                     WALLACE
2712,2712,                         Back! Wait for it to burn!
2713,2713,               INSIDE THE CITY
2714,2714,               The Captain hurries into the tower room.

2721,2721,               Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing 
2722,2722,               the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.
2723,2723,"               They stare at this in mute shock. Wallace is frozen, his "
2724,2724,               eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction. His men rush forward.
2725,2725,                                     WALLACE
2726,2726,                         STOP! NOT YET! LISTEN TO ME!
2727,2727,                              (beat)
2728,2728,                         They wish to frighten us! Or goad us 
2729,2729,                         into attacking too soon! Don't look 
2730,2730,                         away! LOOK!
2731,2731,               The Scots look at the hanging bodies.
2732,2732,                                     WALLACE
2733,2733,                         Behold the enemy we fight! We will 
2734,2734,                         be more merciful than they have been. 
2735,2735,"                         We will spare women, children, and "
2736,2736,"                         priests. For all else, no mercy."
2737,2737,               Wallace draws his broadsword. The burning debris inside the 
2738,2738,"               gate collapses, leaving a tunnel through the fire. Wallace "
2739,2739,"               screams, and leads the charge through the burning barrier."

2745,2745,               Longshanks.
2746,2746,               They lean back into the room and Edward begins to pace

2754,2754,"                         I will stand up to him, and more."
2755,2755,               Longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily. First 
2756,2756,"               he glares at Phillip with obvious loathing, then turns his "
2757,2757,               piercing stare to his own son.
2758,2758,                                     LONGSHANKS
2759,2759,                         What news of the north?
2760,2760,                                     EDWARD
2761,2761,"                         Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent "
2762,2762,                         riders to speed any word.
2763,2763,                                     LONGSHANKS
2764,2764,                         While I am in France fighting to 
2765,2765,                         expand your future kingdom I learn 
2766,2766,"                         that Stirling castle is lost, our "
2767,2767,                         entire northern army wiped out! And 
2768,2768,                         you have done nothing?!
2769,2769,                                     EDWARD
2770,2770,                         I have ordered conscriptions...
2771,2771,               A messenger enters and hands the prince a message. Edward 
2772,2772,               reads it and nearly loses his balance.
2773,2773,                                     EDWARD
2774,2774,                         Wallace has sacked York!
2775,2775,                                     LONGSHANKS
2776,2776,                         Impossible.
2777,2777,                              (to messenger)
2778,2778,                         How dare you bring a panicky lie.
2779,2779,               The messenger has also brought a basket. He approaches the 
2780,2780,"               central table with great dread and places the basket on it, "
2781,2781,               uncovering its contents. Prince Edward is closest; he looks 
2782,2782,"               in, then staggers back, stunned. Longshanks moves to the "
2783,2783,"               sack coldly, looks in, and withdraws the severed head of his "
2784,2784,"               nephew, York's (former) Governor."
2785,2785,                                     PHILLIP
2786,2786,                         Sire! Thy own nephew! What beast 
2787,2787,                         could do such a thing?!
2788,2788,"               The king drops the head back into the sack, unmoved."
2789,2789,                                     LONGSHANKS
2790,2790,"                         If he can sack York, he can invade "
2791,2791,                         lower England.
2792,2792,                                     PHILLIP
2793,2793,                         We would stop him!
2794,2794,                                     LONGSHANKS
2795,2795,"                         Edward, who is this shitpoker who "
2796,2796,                         speaks to me as if I needed his 
2797,2797,                         advice?
2798,2798,                                     EDWARD
2799,2799,                         I have declared Phillip my High 
2800,2800,                         Counselor.
2801,2801,               Longshanks nods as if impressed. He moves to Phillip and 
2802,2802,               examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears.
2803,2803,"               Then Longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window, the "
2804,2804,"               same one Edward and Phillip were looking out, six stories "
2805,2805,               above the courtyard. We hear Phillip's SCREAM as he falls.
2806,2806,               Edward rushes toward the window in horror. He looks out at 
2807,2807,"               the result, turns back toward his father in shock and hatred, "
2808,2808,               and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it.
2809,2809,"               He stabs at Longshanks; the old king smiles at the attack, "
2810,2810,"               parrying, letting his arms be cut."
2811,2811,                                     LONGSHANKS
2812,2812,                         You fight back at last!
2813,2813,               Then Longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples 
2814,2814,"               with Edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the "
2815,2815,"               floor; then Longshanks kicks his son, again and again. He "
2816,2816,               exhausts his fury on him.
2817,2817,               Edward is a bloody mess; Longshanks coughs up a bit of blood.
2818,2818,"               He ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the "
2819,2819,"               discussion, as if this fight was normal business."
2820,2820,                                     LONGSHANKS
2821,2821,"                         We must sue for a truce, and buy him "
2822,2822,                         off. But who will go to him? Not I. 
2823,2823,                         If I came under the sword of this 
2824,2824,"                         murderer, I would end up like my "
2825,2825,"                         nephew. And not you, the sight of my "
2826,2826,                         faggot son would only encourage an 
2827,2827,                         enemy to take over this country. So 
2828,2828,                         whom do I send?
2829,2829,               Longshanks calculates.
2830,2830,               
2831,2831, WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY
2832,2832,"               A full encampment, across an English field; campfires chase "
2833,2833,               the dawn chill. Soldiers sharpen swords and spear points.
2834,2834,"               Wallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except Campbell, "
2835,2835,               who receives a report from a scout.
2836,2836,                                     CAMPBELL
2837,2837,"                         A royal entourage comes, flying "
2838,2838,"                         banners of truce, and the standards "
2839,2839,                         of Longshanks himself!
2840,2840,               Wallace buckles on his sword.
2841,2841,               AN ENGLISH PAVILION TENT - YORKSHIRE - DAY
2842,2842,               Set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. Wallace and his men 
2843,2843,"               ride in, wary, ready for ambush. They surround the tent."
2844,2844,"               There are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no "
2845,2845,               threatening moves.
2846,2846,               No sound from the tent. Wallace rests his hand on the handle 
2847,2847,"               of his broadsword, ready."
2848,2848,                                     WALLACE
2849,2849,                         Longshanks! I have come.
2850,2850,"               Servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, "
2851,2851,"               slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the "
2852,2852,"               shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only "
2853,2853,               one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and 
2854,2854,               Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another 
2855,2855,"               dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves "
2856,2856,"               toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion!"
2857,2857,"               She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess!"
2858,2858,               William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more 
2859,2859,               closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she 
2860,2860,"               carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair."
2861,2861,"               The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, "
2862,2862,"               and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her."
2863,2863,               Their eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she 
2864,2864,               has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life.
2865,2865,"               She surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive "
2866,2866,               yet proud curtsey.
2867,2867,                                     PRINCESS
2868,2868,                         I am the Princess of Wales.
2869,2869,                                     WALLACE
2870,2870,"                         Wife of Edward, the king's son?"
2871,2871,               She nods; somehow she is already ashamed.
2872,2872,                                     PRINCESS
2873,2873,"                         I come as the king's servant, and "
2874,2874,                         with his authority.
2875,2875,                                     WALLACE
2876,2876,"                         It's battle I want, not talk."
2877,2877,                                     PRINCESS
2878,2878,"                         But now that I am here, will you "
2879,2879,                         speak with a woman?
2880,2880,"               She leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading "
2881,2881,               rich carpets laid on the bare ground. Watching the gorgeous 
2882,2882,"               walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg "
2883,2883,"               like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and "
2884,2884,"               Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, "
2885,2885,"               shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, "
2886,2886,               so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots 
2887,2887,"               surround the tent, ready for ambush."
2888,2888,"               Nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, "
2889,2889,               she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The 
2890,2890,"               servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower "
2891,2891,               chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair.
2892,2892,"               She studies him, taking in his anger and his pride."
2893,2893,                                     PRINCESS
2894,2894,                         I understand that you have recently 
2895,2895,                         been given the rank of knight.
2896,2896,                                     WALLACE
2897,2897,                         I have been given nothing. God makes 
2898,2898,                         men what they are.
2899,2899,                                     PRINCESS
2900,2900,                         Did God make you the sacker of 
2901,2901,                         peaceful cities? The executioner of 
2902,2902,"                         the king's nephew, my husband's own "
2903,2903,                         cousin?
2904,2904,                                     WALLACE
2905,2905,                         York was the staging point for every 
2906,2906,                         invasion of my country. And that 
2907,2907,"                         royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, "
2908,2908,"                         even women and children, from the "
2909,2909,                         city walls.
2910,2910,                                     PRINCESS
2911,2911,                         That is not possible.
2912,2912,"               But knowing Longshanks' family, she glances at a richly "
2913,2913,"               dressed Advisor, a CRONY of the king, who averts his eyes."
2914,2914,                                     WALLACE
2915,2915,"                         Longshanks did far worse, the last "
2916,2916,                         time he took a Scottish city.
2917,2917,"               The Crony mumbles to her in LATIN, WITH SUBTITLES..."
2918,2918,                                     CRONY
2919,2919,                              (Latin)
2920,2920,"                         He is a murdering bandit, he lies."
2921,2921,                                     WALLACE
2922,2922,                              (Latin!)
2923,2923,                         I am no bandit. And I do not lie.
2924,2924,               They are startled at Wallace's fluency in Latin.
2925,2925,                                     WALLACE
2926,2926,                         Or in French if you prefer that: 
2927,2927,                         Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to 
2928,2928,"                         his face, and see if his eyes can "
2929,2929,                         convince you of the truth.
2930,2930,               She stares for a long moment at Wallace's eyes.
2931,2931,                                     PRINCESS
2932,2932,"                         Hamilton, leave us."
2933,2933,                                     CRONY (HAMILTON)
2934,2934,                         M'lady --
2935,2935,                                     PRINCESS
2936,2936,                         Leave us now.
2937,2937,               He reluctantly obeys. Seeing that she wants the exchange to 
2938,2938,"               be private, Wallace turns and nods for his men to leave."
2939,2939,"               Stephen, who has been admiring the lady's beauty non-stop, "
2940,2940,               leans in and whispers to William...
2941,2941,                                     STEPHEN
2942,2942,                         Her husband's more of a queen than 
2943,2943,                         she is. Did you know that?
2944,2944,               Stephen moves off with Hamish and Campbell. Wallace and the 
2945,2945,               princess are left alone.
2946,2946,                                     PRINCESS
2947,2947,                         Let us talk plainly. You invade 
2948,2948,                         England. But you cannot complete the 
2949,2949,"                         conquest, so far from your shelter "
2950,2950,                         and supply. The King proposes that 
2951,2951,                         you withdraw your attack. In return 
2952,2952,"                         he grants you title, estates, and "
2953,2953,                         this chest with a thousand pounds of 
2954,2954,"                         gold, which I am to pay to you "
2955,2955,                         personally.
2956,2956,                                     WALLACE
2957,2957,                         A Lordship. And gold. That I should 
2958,2958,                         become Judas.
2959,2959,                                     PRINCESS
2960,2960,                         Peace is made is such ways.
2961,2961,                                     WALLACE
2962,2962,                         SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
2963,2963,               The outburst startles even those watching from a distance.
2964,2964,               The Princess is mesmerized by Wallace's passion.
2965,2965,                                     PRINCESS
2966,2966,                         I understand you have suffered. I 
2967,2967,                         know... about your woman.
2968,2968,                                     WALLACE
2969,2969,                         She was my wife. We married in secret 
2970,2970,                         because I would not share her with 
2971,2971,                         an English lord. They killed her to 
2972,2972,                         get to me. And she was pregnant.
2973,2973,               The Princess is stunned; Wallace is dead still.
2974,2974,                                     WALLACE
2975,2975,                         I've never told anyone. I don't know 
2976,2976,                         why I tell you -- except because you 
2977,2977,                         look... much like her. And someday 
2978,2978,"                         you will be a queen, and you must "
2979,2979,                         open your eyes!
2980,2980,                              (beat)
2981,2981,                         Tell your king that William Wallace 
2982,2982,"                         will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, "
2983,2983,                         while I live.
2984,2984,"               The Princess rises slowly from her chair, moves in front of "
2985,2985,"               him, and lowers herself to her knees. The Crony and her other "
2986,2986,"               attendants, seeing this from a distance, are shocked."
2987,2987,                                     PRINCESS
2988,2988,"                         Sir. I leave this money, as a gift. "
2989,2989,"                         Not from the king, but from myself. "
2990,2990,"                         And not to you, but to the orphans "
2991,2991,                         of your country.
2992,2992,               She lifts her face. Their eyes hold a moment too long.
2993,2993,"               LATER, "
2994,2994, FIELD - DAY
2995,2995,               Wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of 
2996,2996,               their company and watch as the Princess' procession leaves.
2997,2997,               Hamish studies Wallace's face; Wallace notices and gives him 
2998,2998,"               a non-committal shrug. As the carriage rolls away, its window "
2999,2999,               curtains lift back slightly. All they see are the Princess' 
3000,3000,"               fingers, but they know she looked back. Wallace reins his "
3001,3001,"               horse away, to ride back to camp."

3003,3003, EDWARD'S PALACE - DAY
3004,3004,               The doors open; the Princess enters Longshanks' war council; 
3005,3005,"               Prince Edward is there, among a dozen others."
3006,3006,                                     LONGSHANKS

3008,3008,                         by the heathen. So he accepted our 
3009,3009,                         bribe.
3010,3010,                                     PRINCESS
3011,3011,                         No. He did not.
3012,3012,                                     LONGSHANKS
3013,3013,                         Then why does he stay? My scouts say 
3014,3014,                         he has not advanced.
3015,3015,                                     PRINCESS
3016,3016,                         He waits. For you. He says he will 
3017,3017,                         attack no more towns -- if you are 
3018,3018,                         man enough to come fight him.
3019,3019,                                     LONGSHANKS
3020,3020,                         You spoke with this Wallace in 
3021,3021,                         private. What kind of man is he?
3022,3022,                                     PRINCESS
3023,3023,                         ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king

3028,3028,"                         has worked, he must withdraw. You "
3029,3029,                         may return to your embroidery.

3034,3034,"                         You brought back the money, of course?"
3035,3035,               He already knows she didn't; Hamilton is standing near him.
3036,3036,                                     PRINCESS
3037,3037,                         No. I have it to ease the suffering 
3038,3038,                         of the children of this war.
3039,3039,                                     LONGSHANKS

3041,3041,                         This is what happens when you must 
3042,3042,                         send a woman. And a fool.
3043,3043,                                     PRINCESS
3044,3044,"                         Forgive me, Sire. I thought that "
3045,3045,                         generosity might demonstrate your 
3046,3046,                         greatness to those you mean to rule.
3047,3047,                                     LONGSHANKS
3048,3048,                         My greatness is better demonstrated 
3049,3049,                         with this.
3050,3050,               From a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and 
3051,3051,               throws it onto the table. Most of those there are shocked.
3052,3052,                                     EDWARD
3053,3053,                         The weapon has been outlawed by the 
3054,3054,                         Pope himself!

3056,3056,"                         So the Scots will have none of them, "
3057,3057,                         will they? My armorers have already 
3058,3058,                         made a thousand.
3059,3059,               Longshanks smiles. No one notices that the Princess is deadly 
3060,3060,               pale.
3061,3061,               
3062,3062, WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY
3063,3063,               The Scots are lining up to leave their encampment. Wallace 
3064,3064,"               is about to give the signal to start the march when Hamish, "
3065,3065,"               beside him, comes alert; a small group of riders in "
3066,3066,               distinctive attire are coming toward them; what can this be?
3067,3067,                                     HAMISH
3068,3068,                         William -- French guards?
3069,3069,"               The riders stop at a distance, and out from their ranks comes "
3070,3070,"               a single rider, sitting sidesaddle. It is Nicolette."
3071,3071,               Wallace and Hamish recognize her from the Princess's visit.
3072,3072,"               She trots her horse the rest of the way, while the French "
3073,3073,               guards stay back. Hamish helps her from her horse. She moves 
3074,3074,"               to Wallace, and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding "
3075,3075,               cape.
3076,3076,"               Secreted there, hung from a rope at her neck, is a crossbow."

3078,3078, A FIELD IN SCOTLAND - DAY
3079,3079,"               Wallace has gathered the nobles, among them Robert the Bruce, "
3080,3080,"               Mornay, and old Craig, for a demonstration. Hamish and Stephen "
3081,3081,               have placed a spearman's chestplate against a bale of hay. 
3082,3082,               As William cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position 
3083,3083,"               and places a bolt in its slot, Stephen tucks a melon behind "
3084,3084,               the armor.
3085,3085,               William aims... and fires. The bolt slashes through the air 
3086,3086,"               and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt "
3087,3087,               what it would do to a man's heart. The nobles pale.
3088,3088,                                     CRAIG
3089,3089,                         That is why the Pope outlawed the 
3090,3090,                         weapon! It makes war too terrible.
3091,3091,                                     MORNAY
3092,3092,                         How many does Longshanks have?
3093,3093,                                     WALLACE
3094,3094,                         A thousand.
3095,3095,                              (beat)
3096,3096,                         You have made me Guardian of Scotland. 
3097,3097,                         So I tell you this is what we face.
3098,3098,                                     CRAIG
3099,3099,                         We must sue for peace.
3100,3100,                                     WALLACE
3101,3101,                         Peace?!

3105,3105,"                         With cavalry -- not heavy, like the "
3106,3106,"                         English, but light, fast horsemen, "
3107,3107,                         like you nobles employ -- we could 
3108,3108,                         outmaneuver their bowmen!
3109,3109,                                     CRAIG
3110,3110,                         It is suicide.

3112,3112,                         Sir William --
3113,3113,"               The Bruce sees Wallace about to explode, and tries to "
3114,3114,               intervene -- but Wallace's anger is too great.
3115,3115,                                     WALLACE
3116,3116,                         We won at Stirling and still you 
3117,3117,                         quibbled! We won at York and you 
3118,3118,                         would not support us! Then I said 
3119,3119,                         nothing! Now I say you are cowards!
3120,3120,"               The nobles grip their weapons; Wallace, Hamish and Stephen "
3121,3121,"               are ready to finish this quarrel right here. Robert the Bruce, "
3122,3122,"               backed by Mornay, steps between the two sides."
3123,3123,                                     ROBERT
3124,3124,"                         Please, Sir William! Speak with me "
3125,3125,                         alone! I beg you!
3126,3126,"               The nobles stalk away, and Robert draws Wallace away, to the "
3127,3127,"               target Wallace shot, so they are alone."
3128,3128,                                     ROBERT
3129,3129,                         You have achieved more than anyone 
3130,3130,                         dreamed. But fighting these odds 
3131,3131,"                         looks like rage, not courage. Peace "
3132,3132,                         offers its rewards! Has war become a 
3133,3133,                         habit you cannot break?
3134,3134,               The question strikes deep.
3135,3135,                                     WALLACE
3136,3136,                         War finds me willing. I know it won't 
3137,3137,                         bring back all I have lost. But it 
3138,3138,                         can bring what none of us have ever 
3139,3139,                         had -- a country of our own. For 
3140,3140,                         that we need a king. We need you.
3141,3141,                                     ROBERT
3142,3142,                         I am trying.
3143,3143,                                     WALLACE
3144,3144,                         Then tell me what a king is! Is he a 
3145,3145,                         man who believes only what others 
3146,3146,                         believe? Is he one who calculates 
3147,3147,                         the numbers for and against him but 
3148,3148,                         never weighs the strength in your 
3149,3149,                         own heart? There is strength in you. 
3150,3150,                         I see it. I know it.
3151,3151,                                     ROBERT
3152,3152,                         I must... consult with my father.
3153,3153,                                     WALLACE
3154,3154,                         And I will consult with mine.
3155,3155,"               Robert the Bruce walks off the field, heading the way the "
3156,3156,               other nobles went. Wallace rejoins Hamish and Stephen. They 
3157,3157,               look to him; what do we do now?
3158,3158,                                     WALLACE
3159,3159,                         Remember when the English turned 
3160,3160,                         their hounds on us? Maybe we should 
3161,3161,                         introduce them to our dogs.
3162,3162,               
3163,3163," THE DARKENED ROOM OF BRUCE THE ELDER, THE LEPER"
3164,3164,"               In the faint nimbus of the single candle, young Robert sits "
3165,3165,"               across from his leper father. The son grips his own head, as "
3166,3166,               if stunned by a blow.
3167,3167,                                     ROBERT
3168,3168,                         This... cannot be the way.
3169,3169,                                     THE LEPER
3170,3170,                         You have said yourself that the nobles 
3171,3171,"                         will not support Wallace, so how "
3172,3172,                         does it help us to join the side 
3173,3173,                         that is slaughtered?
3174,3174,"               Heartsick, the father reaches across the table, then stays "
3175,3175,"               his arm, unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand."
3176,3176,                                     THE LEPER
3177,3177,                         My son. Look at me. I cannot be king. 
3178,3178,"                         You, and you alone, can rule Scotland. "
3179,3179,"                         What I tell you, you must do -- for "
3180,3180,"                         yourself, and for your country."
3181,3181,"               Young Robert holds his father with his eyes, and does not "
3182,3182,               look away.
3183,3183,               
3184,3184, THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK - DAY
3185,3185,"               The Scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain, covered in "
3186,3186,               the gray mists. They see glimpses of the enemy in the 
3187,3187,               distance. Wallace deploys the Scots: Campbell with the 
3188,3188,"               schiltrons (spear formations), Stephen with the infantry, "
3189,3189,"               the noble Mornay leading the cavalry, and with Wallace and "
3190,3190,"               Hamish on horseback, looking over the field. Hamish sees "
3191,3191,               gazing up at an empty hill above the field.
3192,3192,                                     HAMISH
3193,3193,"                         The Bruce is not coming, William."
3194,3194,                                     WALLACE
3195,3195,                         Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
3196,3196,"               He'd better, the odds look long. And it's nasty ground; one "
3197,3197,"               side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the English "
3198,3198,"               are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick "
3199,3199,               smoke to hide their movements.
3200,3200,                                     WALLACE
3201,3201,                         Stephen ready?
3202,3202,                                     HAMISH
3203,3203,                         Aye.
3204,3204,               The Priest from their home village is moving through the 
3205,3205,"               Scottish ranks, dispensing absolution. He reaches the two "
3206,3206,"               friends, who accept the Host, say their own last prayers, "
3207,3207,               and give each other a look of goodbye. Hamish rides off to 
3208,3208,               join the schiltrons.
3209,3209,               LONGSHANKS AND HIS GENERALS
3210,3210,"               on the opposite side of the field, send their army forward."
3211,3211,               WALLACE AND THE SCOTS
3212,3212,               see them through the smoke; Wallace spots what he's looking 
3213,3213,"               for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen!"
3214,3214,"               And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise. He "
3215,3215,"               sees the bowmen more clearly, and the English infantry. Some "
3216,3216,               are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.
3217,3217,                                     WALLACE
3218,3218,                         Irish troops!
3219,3219,"               STEPHEN OF IRELAND, WITH THE SCOTTISH INFANTRY"
3220,3220,               He stares at the approach of his countrymen. Wallace appears 
3221,3221,"               beside him. Stephen sees him, and is ashamed."
3222,3222,                                     STEPHEN
3223,3223,                         So that's where Longshanks got his 
3224,3224,"                         soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill "
3225,3225,                         Scottish cousins for the English.
3226,3226,                                     WILLIAM
3227,3227,"                         Their families are starving, they'll "
3228,3228,                         feed them however they can. If you 
3229,3229,                         don't want to fight them --
3230,3230,                                     STEPHEN
3231,3231,                         No. I'll stand with you.
3232,3232,"               Loyal to the end. Wallace signals to Hamish and Campbell, "
3233,3233,"               among the schiltrons. The formations, bristling with spears, "
3234,3234,               move forward. Hamish looks back at Wallace; both men know 
3235,3235,               the spearmen are the bait here. Wallace and Stephen see the 
3236,3236,               English heavy cavalry advancing.
3237,3237,                                     STEPHEN
3238,3238,                         They can't be that stupid to attack 
3239,3239,                         the schiltrons again.
3240,3240,               Wallace is scanning the battlefield. He sees the English 
3241,3241,"               cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, "
3242,3242,"               they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights."
3243,3243,                                     WALLACE
3244,3244,                         It's only a faint to shield the 
3245,3245,                         crossbows!
3246,3246,"               The crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly. We see the "
3247,3247,               hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison -- you 
3248,3248,               can actually see them coming. The bows fall short of the 
3249,3249,               front ranks of the schiltrons.
3250,3250,                                     WALLACE
3251,3251,                         Now! Give 'em the dogs!
3252,3252,"               Stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers "
3253,3253,               with ten war dogs.
3254,3254,"               Huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp "
3255,3255,               protrusions. Their handlers hold them at the end of long 
3256,3256,               catch poles. The crossbowmen are distracted from their 
3257,3257,"               reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the "
3258,3258,               Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash 
3259,3259,"               the dogs, fear races through the English line."
3260,3260,"               The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, "
3261,3261,"               and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, "
3262,3262,               mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs; 
3263,3263,               their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked 
3264,3264,"               off, the frenzied dogs keep killing."
3265,3265,               Wallace signals to Mornay with the Scottish cavalry. Mornay 
3266,3266,"               does nothing. The crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, "
3267,3267,"               are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and "
3268,3268,               are regrouping.
3269,3269,                                     WALLACE
3270,3270,                         Now! Charge! Charge them!
3271,3271,               Mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away.
3272,3272,               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND
3273,3273,               Longshanks and his officers see Mornay and his cavalry melt 
3274,3274,               away. The English general looks knowingly at Longshanks.
3275,3275,                                     GENERAL
3276,3276,                         Mornay?
3277,3277,                                     LONGSHANKS
3278,3278,"                         For double his lands in Scotland, "
3279,3279,                         and matching estates in England.
3280,3280,"               WALLACE, WITH STEPHEN"
3281,3281,               They see the Scottish army abandoned.
3282,3282,                                     STEPHEN
3283,3283,                         Betrayed!
3284,3284,               Wallace glances to the other hilltop; still no sign of Bruce.
3285,3285,               He looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another 
3286,3286,"               volley. The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are "
3287,3287,"               helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and "
3288,3288,               breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his 
3289,3289,"               men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen "
3290,3290,               and the infantrymen race behind him.
3291,3291,"               The English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace "
3292,3292,"               weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with "
3293,3293,"               the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another..."
3294,3294,"               The Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, "
3295,3295,               hacking the knights as they run by.
3296,3296,"               The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the "
3297,3297,               Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; 
3298,3298,               the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the 
3299,3299,"               armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, "
3300,3300,"               regains his balance, and keeps up the charge."
3301,3301,               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND
3302,3302,               Longshanks and his generals are watching the action.
3303,3303,                                     GENERAL
3304,3304,"                         My God, and still they come!"
3305,3305,                                     LONGSHANKS
3306,3306,                         Use the reinforcements! But take 
3307,3307,                         Wallace alive!
3308,3308,               The General signals and the English reinforcements surge 
3309,3309,               into the battle.
3310,3310,               IN THE THICK OF THE BATTLE
3311,3311,"               On horseback, Wallace fights his way into the watery edge of "
3312,3312,"               the field, where English infantry is now overrunning the "
3313,3313,"               schiltron. He hacks men down left and right, reaches the "
3314,3314,"               Scottish center, and finds Hamish bending over another "
3315,3315,               soldier. Wallace dismounts.
3316,3316,                                     WALLACE
3317,3317,                         Hamish! Ham --
3318,3318,"               And Wallace sees that Hamish is holding his father, fallen "
3319,3319,               in battle. Wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and 
3320,3320,               English swordsman moving in to hack Hamish's back. Wallace 
3321,3321,"               lifts Campbell across the saddle, and shouts at Hamish..."
3322,3322,                                     WALLACE
3323,3323,                         Get him away!
3324,3324,"               Hamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward "
3325,3325,"               the rear. Wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the "
3326,3326,               double-edged broadsword with deadly accuracy.
3327,3327,"               Rallied by Wallace's presence, the Scots surge back. Then "
3328,3328,               Wallace sees the English reinforcement cavalry coming.
3329,3329,                                     WALLACE
3330,3330,                         A charge! Form up! Form up!
3331,3331,               The Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron.
3332,3332,"               The spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder "
3333,3333,"               in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight "
3334,3334,               of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting.
3335,3335,               Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp 
3336,3336,               body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending 
3337,3337,               to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying...
3338,3338,"               Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The "
3339,3339,               Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over 
3340,3340,"               William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams "
3341,3341,"               into him, William also unseats the rider."
3342,3342,               The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet 
3343,3343,               him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce.
3344,3344,"               The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, "
3345,3345,"               looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he "
3346,3346,"               understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of "
3347,3347,"               Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the "
3348,3348,"               muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it."
3349,3349,               Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He 
3350,3350,"               batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him "
3351,3351,               absolution.
3352,3352,                                     ROBERT
3353,3353,                         Fight me! Fight me!
3354,3354,               But Wallace can only stagger back. Bruce's voice grows ragged 
3355,3355,               as he screams.
3356,3356,                                     ROBERT
3357,3357,                         FIGHT ME!
3358,3358,"               All around, the battle has decayed; the Scots are being "
3359,3359,               slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a 
3360,3360,"               third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse."
3361,3361,"               Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!"
3362,3362,"               He hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to "
3363,3363,               the ground to try and lift William onto the horse!
3364,3364,"               Robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out "
3365,3365,"               Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen "
3366,3366,"               sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him "
3367,3367,"               with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace, "
3368,3368,               as Stephen mounts too.
3369,3369,"               As the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to "
3370,3370,"               the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see "
3371,3371,"               the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the "
3372,3372,               Scots.
3373,3373,"               Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire "
3374,3374,"               and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have "
3375,3375,               died along with his heart.
3376,3376,               LONGSHANKS
3377,3377,"               Looks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the "
3378,3378,"               Scottish dead. For now, he is satisfied."
3379,3379,               
3380,3380, ROAD - SUNSET
3381,3381,               Remnants of the defeated army straggle past. Wallace and 
3382,3382,"               Stephen are trying to help Hamish carry his father, but now "
3383,3383,               old Campbell says...
3384,3384,                                     CAMPBELL
3385,3385,                         Son... I want to die on the ground.
3386,3386,"               But as they tilt old Campbell onto the ground, he grabs at "
3387,3387,               something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach.
3388,3388,                                     CAMPBELL
3389,3389,                         Whew. That'll clear your sinuses. 
3390,3390,"                         Goodbye, boys."
3391,3391,                                     HAMISH
3392,3392,                         No. You're going to live.
3393,3393,                                     CAMPBELL
3394,3394,                         I don't think I can do without one 
3395,3395,                         of those... whatever it is...
3396,3396,               Hamish is too grief-stricken to speak.
3397,3397,                                     WALLACE
3398,3398,                         You... were like my father...
3399,3399,               Old Campbell rallies one more time for this.
3400,3400,                                     CAMPBELL
3401,3401,"                         ...And glad to die, like him... So "
3402,3402,                         you could be the men you are. All of 
3403,3403,                         ya.
3404,3404,"               The last three words to Hamish, telling him he's a hero too."
3405,3405,                                     CAMPBELL
3406,3406,                         I'm a happy man.
3407,3407,"               Hamish is weeping. When he looks up again, his father has "
3408,3408,"               died. We PULL BACK from them in tableaux, with the army, the "
3409,3409,"               people of Scotland, the whole gray world in defeat."
3410,3410,               
3411,3411, EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY
3412,3412,"               Wallace, still bloody and in his battered armor, removes the "
3413,3413,"               chain of office from beneath his breastplate, lays it onto "
3414,3414,"               the table in front of Craig and the other nobles, and walks "
3415,3415,               from the room. Hamish and Stephen see the satisfaction on 
3416,3416,"               the nobles' face, and follow William out."
3417,3417,               
3418,3418, CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY
3419,3419,               Hamish and Stephen move out into the hallway after Wallace -- 
3420,3420,               but he is gone.
3421,3421,               
3422,3422, WOODS - NIGHT
3423,3423,"               Wallace is in the woods, in the grove of trees, looking at "
3424,3424,"               Marion's hidden grave. The rain falls on his face, like tears. "
3425,3425,"               But he has no tears of his own. The cold, the icy rain, the "
3426,3426,"               wounds, nothing seems to touch him."
3427,3427,               With his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth 
3428,3428,"               from beneath his breastplate; hanging in his trembling hands, "
3429,3429,"               filthy with the grime and gore of battle, it looks impossibly "
3430,3430,"               white, something from a better, purer world."
3431,3431,                                                               DISSOLVE TO:
3432,3432,               
3433,3433, PALACE IN LONDON - NIGHT
3434,3434,"               Thunder, the sound of driving rain. Snug by a massive fire "
3435,3435,"               are Longshanks, his son Edward, and other advisors. On the "
3436,3436,"               far side of the room, away from the fire, the Princess stands "
3437,3437,               at the window and watches the rain against the panes.
3438,3438,                                     ADVISOR
3439,3439,"                         Their nobles have sworn allegiance, "
3440,3440,                         M'lord. Every last one.
3441,3441,               Longshanks savors the victory -- and gloats to his son.
3442,3442,                                     LONGSHANKS
3443,3443,                         Now we kill two birds at one stroke. 
3444,3444,                         We recruit from Scotland for our 
3445,3445,                         armies in France.
3446,3446,                                     EDWARD
3447,3447,                         The Scots will fight for us?
3448,3448,                                     LONGSHANKS
3449,3449,                         What choice do they have? Now they 
3450,3450,                         must serve us or starve.
3451,3451,                                     EDWARD
3452,3452,                         But if we have not caught Wallace --
3453,3453,                                     LONGSHANKS
3454,3454,                              (exploding)
3455,3455,                         He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he 
3456,3456,                         has not yet bled to death or had his 
3457,3457,"                         throat cut for him, he will not "
3458,3458,                         survive the winter. It is very cold -- 
3459,3459,"                         is it not, our flower?"
3460,3460,"               From the other side of the window, we see the Princess as "
3461,3461,"               she hears him, but doesn't turn around. She looks at the "
3462,3462,"               window, we snow swirling among the raindrops outside. Her "
3463,3463,"               eyes glisten, and her breath fogs the glass."
3464,3464,               
3465,3465, BRUCE'S DARKENED CHAMBER
3466,3466,"               The elder Bruce, his decaying features sagging from his face, "
3467,3467,               stares across the table at his son.
3468,3468,                                     LEPER
3469,3469,                         I am the one who is rotting. But I 
3470,3470,                         think your face looks graver than 
3471,3471,                         mine.
3472,3472,                                     ROBERT
3473,3473,                         He was so brave. With courage alone 
3474,3474,                         he nearly won.
3475,3475,                                     LEPER
3476,3476,                         So more men were slaughtered 
3477,3477,                         uselessly!
3478,3478,                                     ROBERT
3479,3479,                         He broke because of me. I saw it. He 
3480,3480,                         lost all will to fight.
3481,3481,                                     LEPER
3482,3482,                         We must have alliance with England 
3483,3483,                         to prevail here. You achieved that! 
3484,3484,"                         You saved your family, increased "
3485,3485,                         your lands! In time you will have 
3486,3486,                         all the power in Scotland!... Yet 
3487,3487,                         you grieve.
3488,3488,                                     ROBERT
3489,3489,                         In my heart I had begun to hope that 
3490,3490,                         he would never break.
3491,3491,                                     LEPER
3492,3492,                         All men lose heart. All betray. It 
3493,3493,                         is exactly why we must make the 
3494,3494,                         choices we make.

3496,3496, MORNAY'S CASTLE - NIGHT
3497,3497,"               Mornay, in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and "
3498,3498,"               carpeted with eastern rugs, lies in bed, tossing in the "
3499,3499,               restless sleep of a tortured soul.
3500,3500,               He thinks he hears galloping. In SUBLIMINAL FLASHES he DREAMS 
3501,3501,               of Wallace riding toward him.
3502,3502,"               He wakes, and listens to a strange noise. It is hoofbeats!"
3503,3503,"               Coming closer. He hears shouts too, screams from below -- "
3504,3504,"               and those strange, approaching hoofbeats..."
3505,3505,"               WALLACE, ON HORSEBACK"
3506,3506,               rides up the circular stairs inside Mornay's castle! His 
3507,3507,"               horse bounds up the stone -- Mornay's guards are behind him, "
3508,3508,"               on foot, pursuing."
3509,3509,"               At a landing, Wallace cuts down a guard, and gallops higher."
3510,3510,"               IN HIS BED, MORNAY"
3511,3511,               sits up gawking as the door explodes inward and Wallace rides 
3512,3512,               through! Mornay is frozen. Wallace slashes him down.
3513,3513,"               Out in the corridor, the guards gather; they have Wallace "
3514,3514,               trapped. He covers the horse's eyes with a cloth and spurs 
3515,3515,               his flanks. The blind animal runs through the window!

3518,3518,               The horse and rider plunge past the sheer walls of the 
3519,3519,               castle... and into the loch! Mornay's guards and the castle 
3520,3520,               servants cluster at the windows to see Wallace and the horse 
3521,3521,"               surface, and swim to the shore, escaping!"
3522,3522,               
3523,3523, SCOTTISH VILLAGE - DAY
3524,3524,               The news has spread through the countryside. In the town 
3525,3525,"               square, drunken Scotsmen chant..."
3526,3526,                                     PEOPLE
3527,3527,                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!
3528,3528,"               Old Craig rides past them, heading toward the Bruce's castle "
3529,3529,               on the hill above the town.
3530,3530,               
3531,3531, BRUCE CASTLE - DAY
3532,3532,               Robert is in his central room; he hears the chanting from 
3533,3533,               far below. Old Craig enters.
3534,3534,                                     ROBERT
3535,3535,                         Is it true about Mornay?
3536,3536,               Craig hands him the bloody nightshirt Mornay was wearing.
3537,3537,                                     ROBERT
3538,3538,                         And he rode through the window? My 
3539,3539,                         God.
3540,3540,"               He can't hide his admiration. From below, he still hears the "
3541,3541,               people CHANTING...
3542,3542,               
3543,3543, LONDON - GARDENS - DAY
3544,3544,"               Longshanks and Edward are in the royal gardens, resplendent "
3545,3545,"               with spring. Longshanks pulls a new flower, and crushes it."
3546,3546,                                     LONGSHANKS
3547,3547,                         His legend grows! It will be worse 
3548,3548,                         than before!
3549,3549,                                     EDWARD
3550,3550,                         You let Wallace escape your whole 
3551,3551,                         army. You cannot blame me for this.
3552,3552,               Longshanks glowers at his son; the Princess arrives.
3553,3553,                                     PRINCESS
3554,3554,"                         Good day to you, M'Lords."
3555,3555,                                     EDWARD
3556,3556,                         You mock us with a smile?
3557,3557,                                     PRINCESS
3558,3558,                         I am cheerful with a plan to soothe 
3559,3559,                         your miseries. All of England shudders 
3560,3560,                         with the news of renewed rebellion.
3561,3561,                                     EDWARD
3562,3562,                         Wallace's followers.
3563,3563,                                     PRINCESS
3564,3564,                         Wallace himself. If you wish to 
3565,3565,                         pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers 
3566,3566,"                         in every Scottish town, I leave you "
3567,3567,                         to your hauntings. If you wish to 
3568,3568,"                         take him, I know a way."
3569,3569,               Edward snickers in derision -- but his wife is steel.
3570,3570,                                     PRINCESS
3571,3571,                         I have faced him. Have you?
3572,3572,                                     LONGSHANKS
3573,3573,                         Let her speak.
3574,3574,                                     PRINCESS
3575,3575,                         He will fight you forever. But what 
3576,3576,"                         does he fight for? Freedom first, "
3577,3577,                         and peace. So grant them.
3578,3578,                                     EDWARD
3579,3579,                         The little cow is insane --
3580,3580,                                     PRINCESS
3581,3581,"                         Grant, as you do everything else, "
3582,3582,                         with treachery. Offer him a truce to 
3583,3583,"                         discuss terms, and send me to my "
3584,3584,                         castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. 
3585,3585,                         He trusts me. Pick thirty of your 
3586,3586,                         finest assassins for me to take along. 
3587,3587,"                         And I will set the meeting, and the "
3588,3588,                         ambush.
3589,3589,                                     LONGSHANKS
3590,3590,"                         You see, my delicate son? I have "
3591,3591,                         picked you a Queen.
3592,3592,               
3593,3593, THE PRINCESS' SCOTTISH CASTLE - DAY
3594,3594,"               Locharmbie is a small, picturesque castle on a hillside. As "
3595,3595,"               the queen's entourage moves through the gates, they close "
3596,3596,               behind her. She steps out of the carriage and moves into
3597,3597,               
3598,3598, CASTLE - THE GREAT HALL - DAY
3599,3599,"               Inside the great hall are thirty killers, led by their CHIEF "
3600,3600,"               ASSASSIN, a cutthroat with a mangled eye."
3601,3601,                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
3602,3602,"                         We came in small groups, so the rebels "
3603,3603,                         would not suspect.
3604,3604,                                     PRINCESS
3605,3605,                         And you have reached Wallace's men?
3606,3606,                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
3607,3607,"                         We tell the villagers, and the "
3608,3608,                         traitors pass it on. All that's left 
3609,3609,                         is for you to say where.
3610,3610,               
3611,3611, MARION'S GROVE - NIGHT
3612,3612,               Wallace is in the grove of trees where Marion is buried.
3613,3613,"               Drinking in the silence, his own isolation. He hears a RUSTLE "
3614,3614,"               behind him, and spins, drawing the broadsword. Then his face "
3615,3615,               registers... it's Hamish and Stephen.
3616,3616,               Hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here -- 
3617,3617,"               unsure, until Wallace moves to them, and hugs them."
3618,3618,               
3619,3619, CAVE - NIGHT
3620,3620,"               They are in the old secret cave; rain is falling, but it's "
3621,3621,"               dry inside, with a campfire smoldering at the entrance."
3622,3622,                                     WALLACE
3623,3623,                         Thanks for the food and drink. And 
3624,3624,                         for bringing 'em yourselves.
3625,3625,                                     HAMISH
3626,3626,                         We're here to stay. We don't care to 
3627,3627,"                         live, if we can't fight beside ya."
3628,3628,"               Stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket. He swigs, "
3629,3629,"               hands it to Hamish for a chug, then to Wallace, who declines, "
3630,3630,               but smiles for the first time in many weeks.
3631,3631,                                     HAMISH
3632,3632,"                         There is... one thing, William. "
3633,3633,                         Longshanks is offering a truce. He 
3634,3634,                         has dispatched his daughter-in-law 
3635,3635,"                         as his emissary, and she has sent "
3636,3636,                         word that she wishes to meet you -- 
3637,3637,                         in a barn.
3638,3638,               Wallace frowns; a barn?
3639,3639,               
3640,3640, A BARN IN THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
3641,3641,               Hauntingly similar to the one in Wallace's childhood. As he 
3642,3642,"               sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a "
3643,3643,"               white flag of truce, it gives him a chill. But in full view "
3644,3644,"               of the barn, he hands Hamish his sword and rides forward."
3645,3645,               INSIDE THE BARN
3646,3646,"               are the assassins, killing knives ready."
3647,3647,                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
3648,3648,"                         It's William Wallace, sure! And... "
3649,3649,                         he's given up his sword! Be ready!
3650,3650,               They position themselves at every entrance.
3651,3651,               OUTSIDE THE BARN
3652,3652,"               Wallace reaches the barn, dismounts, and moves toward the "
3653,3653,"               door. But suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy "
3654,3654,"               bar and seals the door! At this motion, Scots spring from "
3655,3655,               the woods in all directions. The assassins inside realize 
3656,3656,"               the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they "
3657,3657,               hear the entrance being sealed from the outside.
3658,3658,"               More Scots, led by Stephen, scramble up from hiding, place "
3659,3659,"               tinder-dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on "
3660,3660,               fire. In moments the entire barn is blazing. The Scots stand 
3661,3661,"               back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames. "
3662,3662,"               After awhile, there are no more screams from inside."
3663,3663,               
3664,3664, CASTLE - NIGHT
3665,3665,"               The Princess sees the burning off in the distance, like a "
3666,3666,"               bonfire. She stands on the wall, looking out at it. And then "
3667,3667,"               she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and "
3668,3668,"               the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking "
3669,3669,"               at the castle. She runs into the castle, up the stairs, and "
3670,3670,"               stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is "
3671,3671,"               silhouetted, and he can see her."
3672,3672,               The lone rider is William Wallace.
3673,3673,               CLOSE - A CANDLE
3674,3674,"               being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into "
3675,3675,"               the outer wall of the castle. AT A DISTANCE, the candle burns "
3676,3676,               like a tiny beacon. And William sees it.
3677,3677,"               INSIDE THE STABLE COTTAGE, THE PRINCESS"
3678,3678,"               sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work."
3679,3679,               OUTSIDE THE CASTLE
3680,3680,"               Wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared "
3681,3681,"               stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground."
3682,3682,               He reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the 
3683,3683,"               ledge. He looks through the window, and sees her inside."
3684,3684,"               INSIDE THE ROOM, she looks up, and sees him there. The first "
3685,3685,"               glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for "
3686,3686,"               him to come. Now, for a long, long moment the two of them "
3687,3687,"               look at each other through the glass, each realizing the "
3688,3688,               implications of this moment.
3689,3689,               She moves to the window and opens it. The wind rushing through 
3690,3690,"               extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside. They face each "
3691,3691,               other in the darkness. Then she strikes a match and relights 
3692,3692,"               the candle, and they look at each other."
3693,3693,                                     WALLACE
3694,3694,                         A meeting in a barn. It had to be a 
3695,3695,                         trap. And only you would know I would 
3696,3696,                         be aware of it.
3697,3697,                                     PRINCESS
3698,3698,                         It does me good to see you.
3699,3699,                                     WILLIAM
3700,3700,                         I am much diminished since we met.
3701,3701,               She wants to say something -- but instead she says something 
3702,3702,               else.
3703,3703,                                     PRINCESS
3704,3704,                         There will be a new shipment of 
3705,3705,                         supplies coming north next month. 
3706,3706,                         Food and weapons. They will trav --
3707,3707,                                     WILLIAM
3708,3708,                         No. Stop. I didn't come here for 
3709,3709,                         that.
3710,3710,                                     PRINCESS
3711,3711,                         Then why did you come?
3712,3712,                                     WALLACE
3713,3713,                         Why did you?
3714,3714,                                     PRINCESS
3715,3715,                         Because of the way you're looking at 
3716,3716,                         me now. The same way... as when we 
3717,3717,                         met.
3718,3718,"               He turns his face away. Gently, she pulls it back."
3719,3719,                                     PRINCESS
3720,3720,                         I know. You looked at me... and saw 
3721,3721,                         her.
3722,3722,               He twists back toward the window.
3723,3723,                                     PRINCESS
3724,3724,                         You must forgive me what I feel. No 
3725,3725,                         man has ever looked at me as you 
3726,3726,                         did.
3727,3727,"               Surprised, he looks at her now."
3728,3728,                                     WALLACE
3729,3729,                         You have... you have a husband.
3730,3730,                                     PRINCESS
3731,3731,                         I have taken vows. More than one. 
3732,3732,"                         I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, "
3733,3733,                         and sworn to give him a son. And I 
3734,3734,                         cannot keep both promises.
3735,3735,"               Slowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an "
3736,3736,               unexpected smile plays at his lips. Her smile lights too.
3737,3737,                                     PRINCESS
3738,3738,"                         You understand. Consider, before you "
3739,3739,                         laugh and say no. You will never own 
3740,3740,"                         a throne, though you deserve one. "
3741,3741,                         But just as the sun will rise 
3742,3742,"                         tomorrow, some man will rule England. "
3743,3743,                         And what if his veins ran not with 
3744,3744,"                         the blood of Longshanks, but with "
3745,3745,                         that of a true king?
3746,3746,                                     WALLACE
3747,3747,                         I cannot love you for the sake of 
3748,3748,                         revenge.
3749,3749,                                     PRINCESS
3750,3750,                         No. But can you love me for the sake 
3751,3751,                         of all you loved and lost? Or simply 
3752,3752,                         love me... because I love you?
3753,3753,"               Slowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out."
3754,3754,               IN THE SHADOWS OF THE COTTAGE BED
3755,3755,"               we see the surging, pent-up passion... and"
3756,3756,                                                               DISSOLVE TO:
3757,3757,               THE LOVERS
3758,3758,"               Their bodies limp, they lie asleep, entwined. The first rays "
3759,3759,               of morning spread yellow light through the room and across 
3760,3760,               their faces.
3761,3761,"               Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight! He grabs for his clothes, "
3762,3762,"               as she wakes, covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of "
3763,3763,"               bed, rushing to the window to look out."
3764,3764,                                     PRINCESS
3765,3765,                         No one! Hurry!
3766,3766,"               He reaches her, throws the window open, and sees a clear "
3767,3767,"               path down the wall to safety. He stops and looks at her, and "
3768,3768,               touches her face in gratitude. She has to ask...
3769,3769,                                     PRINCESS
3770,3770,                         When we... did you think of her?
3771,3771,"               Pausing to look straight into her eyes, he kisses her -- "
3772,3772,"               her, not Marion -- and climbs out. She watches him go."
3773,3773,               
3774,3774, GROVE OF TREES - NIGHT
3775,3775,               Wallace stands alone in the grove where Marion lies.
3776,3776,               MONTAGE
3777,3777,               -- Wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way 
3778,3778,               to an English fortress; the villagers drop what they're doing 
3779,3779,"               and run to follow them; we see Wallace's face, relentless, "
3780,3780,               as he hacks men down in the attack; with the fortress sacked 
3781,3781,"               and smoking in the background, we see Wallace lead his men "
3782,3782,"               away, the people cheering him..."
3783,3783,               
3784,3784, FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
3785,3785,"               Once again, Wallace stares at the fire, beside his friends."
3786,3786,                                     HAMISH
3787,3787,"                         Rest, William."
3788,3788,                                     WALLACE
3789,3789,                         I rest.
3790,3790,                                     HAMISH
3791,3791,                         Your rest is making me exhausted.
3792,3792,               Stephen offers the jug; Wallace declines.
3793,3793,                                     STEPHEN
3794,3794,"                         Come, it'll help you sleep."
3795,3795,                                     WALLACE
3796,3796,                         Aye. But it won't let me dream.
3797,3797,"               Pulling a tattered tartan around himself, he lies down."
3798,3798,"               LONGSHANKS, "
3799,3799, HIS PALACE - NIGHT
3800,3800,"               He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still "
3801,3801,"               he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood. But he "
3802,3802,               ignores the ice in his lungs; his mind is plotting.
3803,3803,"               THE PRINCESS, "
3804,3804, THE WALLS OF HER CASTLE - NIGHT
3805,3805,"               she walks the parapets alone, lost in her own thoughts."
3806,3806,"               ROBERT THE BRUCE, IN A STONE ROOM OF HIS CASTLE"
3807,3807,               sits staring at... the stone coffin of his father. The coffin 
3808,3808,               is closed; on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his 
3809,3809,               father as a knight in final repose. Ranks of candles light 
3810,3810,"               the scene, and Robert's face, cold as the stone. A SHUFFLE... "
3811,3811,               Robert looks up to see old Craig.
3812,3812,                                     CRAIG
3813,3813,                         May he rest in peace... You have 
3814,3814,                         already sealed the coffin?
3815,3815,                                     ROBERT
3816,3816,                         He was a modest man.

3818,3818,                         It will not be long before Longshanks 
3819,3819,"                         too is encased in stone, and his "
3820,3820,                         crowns divided for others to wear.
3821,3821,"               Craig sits next to Robert, and keeps his voice low."

3823,3823,                         Our nobles are frightened and 
3824,3824,                         confused... Wallace has the commoners 
3825,3825,"                         stirred up again, from the Highland "
3826,3826,                         clans to the lowland villages. In 
3827,3827,                         another six months Christ and the 
3828,3828,                         Apostles could not govern this 
3829,3829,                         country.
3830,3830,               Robert only stares at his father's stone coffin.
3831,3831,                                     CRAIG
3832,3832,                         Longshanks knows his son will scarcely 
3833,3833,"                         be able to rule England, much less "
3834,3834,                         half of France. He needs Scotland 
3835,3835,"                         settled, and he trusts you, after "
3836,3836,"                         Falkirk. If you pay him homage, he "
3837,3837,                         will recognize you as king of 
3838,3838,                         Scotland. Our nobles have agreed to 
3839,3839,                         this as well.
3840,3840,               He shows Robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in 
3841,3841,               Scotland. The Bruce barely glances at it.
3842,3842,                                     ROBERT
3843,3843,"                         If I pay homage to another's throne, "
3844,3844,                         then how am I a king?
3845,3845,                                     CRAIG
3846,3846,                         Homage is nothing. It is the crown 
3847,3847,                         that matters!
3848,3848,                                     ROBERT
3849,3849,                         The crown is that of Scotland. And 
3850,3850,                         Scotland is William Wallace.
3851,3851,                                     CRAIG
3852,3852,                         That is another matter. There is a 
3853,3853,"                         price to all this, required both by "
3854,3854,"                         Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, "
3855,3855,                         and you will be our king. And we 
3856,3856,                         will have peace.
3857,3857,"               Robert turns from his father's coffin, to look at Craig."

3859,3859, FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
3860,3860,"               A commotion; the nobles, their heads hooded, are led in on "
3861,3861,"               horseback by guerrillas from the village. The nobles stop, "
3862,3862,"               feel their hoods pulled off, and see Wallace."
3863,3863,                                     CRAIG
3864,3864,                         Sir William. We come to seek a 
3865,3865,                         meeting.
3866,3866,                                     WALLACE
3867,3867,                         You've all sworn to Longshanks.
3868,3868,                                     CRAIG
3869,3869,                         An oath to a liar is no oath at all. 
3870,3870,                         An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. 
3871,3871,                         Every man of us is ready to swear 
3872,3872,                         loyalty to you.
3873,3873,                                     WALLACE
3874,3874,                         So let the council swear publicly.
3875,3875,                                     CRAIG
3876,3876,                         We cannot. Some scarcely believe you 
3877,3877,                         are alive. Other think you'll pay 
3878,3878,                         them Mornay's wages. We bid you to 
3879,3879,"                         Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, "
3880,3880,"                         two days from now, at sunset. Pledge "
3881,3881,                         us your pardon and we will unite 
3882,3882,                         behind you. Scotland will be one.
3883,3883,"               Wallace glances at Hamish and Stephen, who can barely hide "
3884,3884,               their contempt. Wallace looks at the nobles.
3885,3885,                                     WALLACE
3886,3886,"                         I will meet you, but only one way -- "
3887,3887,"                         if Robert the Bruce is there, and "
3888,3888,"                         puts his hand on my Bible, and swears "
3889,3889,                         his loyalty to Scotland.
3890,3890,                                     CRAIG
3891,3891,                         He has already agreed to come.
3892,3892,               
3893,3893, FOREST - NIGHT
3894,3894,"               Wallace stands alone, looking at the moon and stars. Hamish "
3895,3895,               moves up and sits down beside him.
3896,3896,                                     HAMISH
3897,3897,                         You know it's a trap.
3898,3898,                                     WALLACE

3906,3906,                         god for those things. But He's brought 
3907,3907,                         me this sword. And if He wills that

3922,3922,                         My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed

3950,3950,               They hear the approach of a single horse. The Bruce looks

4095,4095,               to distract her.
4096,4096,                                     WALLACE
4097,4097,                         M'lady... what kindness of you to 
4098,4098,                         visit a stranger.
4099,4099,                                     PRINCESS
4100,4100,"                         Sir, I... come to beg you to confess "
4101,4101,"                         all, and swear allegiance to the "
4102,4102,"                         king, that he might show you mercy."
4103,4103,                                     WALLACE
4104,4104,                         Will he show mercy to my country? 
4105,4105,"                         Will he take back his soldiers, and "
4106,4106,                         let us rule ourselves?
4107,4107,                                     PRINCESS
4108,4108,                         Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps 
4109,4109,"                         even live in the Tower. In time, who "
4110,4110,"                         knows what can happen, if you can "
4111,4111,                         only live.
4112,4112,                                     WALLACE
4113,4113,"                         If I swear to him, then everything I "
4114,4114,                         am is dead already.
4115,4115,"               She wants to plead, she wants to scream. She can't stop the "
4116,4116,               tears. And the jailers are watching.
4117,4117,                                     WALLACE
4118,4118,                         Your people are lucky to have a 
4119,4119,                         princess so kind that she can grieve 
4120,4120,                         at the death of a stranger.
4121,4121,"               She almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him -- but "
4122,4122,"               she doesn't care. She whispers, pleading..."
4123,4123,                                     PRINCESS
4124,4124,                         You will die! It will be awful!
4125,4125,                                     WALLACE
4126,4126,                         Every man dies. Not every man really 
4127,4127,                         lives.
4128,4128,"               She pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers..."
4129,4129,                                     PRINCESS
4130,4130,                         Drink this! It will dull your pain.
4131,4131,                                     WALLACE
4132,4132,"                         It will numb my wits, and I must "
4133,4133,"                         have them all. If I'm senseless, or "
4134,4134,"                         if I wail, then Longshanks will have "
4135,4135,                         broken me.
4136,4136,                                     PRINCESS
4137,4137,                         I can't bear the thought of your 
4138,4138,                         torture. Take it!
4139,4139,"               On the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air "
4140,4140,"               hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. The jailers, seeing "
4141,4141,"               suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, "
4142,4142,"               her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. From inside the "
4143,4143,"               mask, he watches her go. When the door CLANGS shut, he spits "
4144,4144,               the purple drug out through the mouth hole.
4145,4145,               
4146,4146, LONGSHANKS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
4147,4147,"               Longshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption."
4148,4148,"               Edward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his "
4149,4149,"               eyes. The Princess enters, and marches to the bedside."
4150,4150,                                     PRINCESS
4151,4151,                         I have come to beg for the life of 
4152,4152,                         William Wallace.
4153,4153,                                     EDWARD
4154,4154,                         You fancy him.
4155,4155,                                     PRINCESS
4156,4156,                         I respect him. At worst he was a 
4157,4157,                         worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou 
4158,4158,                         great king... and win the respect of 
4159,4159,                         your own people.
4160,4160,               Longshanks shakes his head.
4161,4161,                                     PRINCESS
4162,4162,"                         Even now, you are incapable of mercy?"
4163,4163,               The king can't speak. But hatred still glows in his eyes.
4164,4164,               The princess looks at her husband.
4165,4165,                                     PRINCESS
4166,4166,                         Nor you. To you that word is as 
4167,4167,                         unfamiliar as love.
4168,4168,                                     EDWARD
4169,4169,"                         Before he lost his powers of speech, "
4170,4170,                         he told me his one comfort was that 
4171,4171,                         he would live to know Wallace was 
4172,4172,                         dead.
4173,4173,               She leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. The 
4174,4174,               guards flanking the door start forward but the Princess's 
4175,4175,               eyes flare at them with more fire than even Longshanks once 
4176,4176,               showed -- and the guards back off. She leans down and hisses 
4177,4177,"               to Longshanks, so softly that even Edward can't hear..."
4178,4178,                                     PRINCESS
4179,4179,                         You see? Death comes to us all. And 
4180,4180,                         it comes to William Wallace. But 
4181,4181,"                         before death comes to you, know this: "
4182,4182,                         your blood dies with you. A child 
4183,4183,                         who is not of your line grows in my 
4184,4184,                         belly. Your son will not sit long on 
4185,4185,                         the throne. I swear it.
4186,4186,               She lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back 
4187,4187,               onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband 
4188,4188,"               she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the "
4189,4189,               dying king rasping the air like a saw.
4190,4190,               
4191,4191, LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY
4192,4192,"               The crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer "
4193,4193,"               from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped "
4194,4194,               to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through 
4195,4195,"               the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: "
4196,4196,"               chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards."
4197,4197,"               We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in "
4198,4198,"               terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street "
4199,4199,               and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.
4200,4200,"               Wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing "
4201,4201,"               his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest "
4202,4202,               of the crowd jeers more.
4203,4203,               Grim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution 
4204,4204,"               platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table "
4205,4205,"               with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an "
4206,4206,               enormous axe. Wallace sees it all.
4207,4207,                                     MAGISTRATE
4208,4208,                         We will use it all before this is 
4209,4209,"                         over. Or fall to your knees now, "
4210,4210,                         declare yourself the king's loyal 
4211,4211,"                         subject, and beg his mercy, and you "
4212,4212,                         shall have it.
4213,4213,"               He emphasizes \""mercy\"" by pointing to the axe. Wallace is "
4214,4214,"               pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows "
4215,4215,               noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck...
4216,4216,               WE 
4217,4217,RCUT:
4218,4218,"               -- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE "
4219,4219,               from her room in the palace...
4220,4220,"               -- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, "
4221,4221,"               helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain."
4222,4222,"               -- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches."
4223,4223,               -- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in 
4224,4224,               Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered 
4225,4225,               handkerchief that belonged to Wallace.
4226,4226,               ON THE EXECUTION STAND
4227,4227,               a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around 
4228,4228,               Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole.
4229,4229,                                     CROWD
4230,4230,                         That's it! Stretch him!
4231,4231,"               In the SCORE, AMAZING GRACE, wailed on bagpipes, carries "
4232,4232,"               through all that happens now... Ties hand and foot, Wallace "
4233,4233,               is strangling. The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the 
4234,4234,               executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go 
4235,4235,"               too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods "
4236,4236,               and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the 
4237,4237,               platform; the Magistrate leans to him.
4238,4238,                                     MAGISTRATE
4239,4239,"                         Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, "
4240,4240,"                         kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, "
4241,4241,                         and you will feel no more.
4242,4242,"               With great effort, Wallace rises to his knees. The Magistrate "
4243,4243,               assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak.
4244,4244,               Wallace struggles all the way to his feet.
4245,4245,                                     MAGISTRATE
4246,4246,                         Very well then. Rack him.
4247,4247,"               The executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, "
4248,4248,"               spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by "
4249,4249,"               the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet "
4250,4250,               enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and 
4251,4251,               Stephen feel it in their own bodies.
4252,4252,                                     MAGISTRATE
4253,4253,"                         Wonderful, isn't it, that a man "
4254,4254,                         remains conscious through such pain. 
4255,4255,                         Enough?
4256,4256,"               Wallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, "
4257,4257,               take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we 
4258,4258,"               see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, "
4259,4259,               but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; 
4260,4260,               Wallace wants to say something.
4261,4261,                                     WALLACE
4262,4262,                         That... will... clear your sinuses.
4263,4263,"               Everyone hears; Hamish smiles, even through his tears."
4264,4264,"               Rebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift "
4265,4265,               the terrible instruments of dissection.
4266,4266,               We are spared seeing the cutting: we are ON WALLACE'S FACE 
4267,4267,               as the disembowelment begins. The Magistrate leans in beside 
4268,4268,               him.
4269,4269,                                     MAGISTRATE
4270,4270,                         It can all end. Right now! Bliss. 
4271,4271,"                         Peace. Just say it. Cry out. \""Mercy!\"" "
4272,4272,                         Yes?... Yes?
4273,4273,               The crowd can't hear the magistrate but they know the 
4274,4274,"               procedure, and they goad Wallace, chanting..."
4275,4275,                                     CROWD
4276,4276,                         Mer-cy! Mer-cy! Mer-cy!
4277,4277,"               Wallace's eyes roll to the magistrate, who signals QUIET!"
4278,4278,                                     MAGISTRATE
4279,4279,                              (booming)
4280,4280,                         The prisoner wishes to say a word!
4281,4281,"               SILENCE. Hamish and Stephen weep, whisper, pray..."

4299,4299,               head on the block. The executioner lifts his huge axe -- and
