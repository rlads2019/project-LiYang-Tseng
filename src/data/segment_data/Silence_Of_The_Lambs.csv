"3",3,"               A woman's face BACKS "
"4",4," SHOT, her head resting against "
"5",5,"               grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with "
"6",6,"               concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, "
"7",7,"               very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy "
"8",8,"               windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a "
"9",9,"               navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, "
"10",10,"               hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left "
"11",11,"               hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads."
"12",12,"               CLOSE ON"
"13",13,"               A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its "
"14",14,"               knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and "
"15",15,"               the door bursts open."
"16",16,"               WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT"
"17",17,"               as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She "
"18",18,"               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at "
"19",19,"               the ready in both hands..."
"20",20,"                                                                    "

"22",22," HOTEL ROOM - DAY"
"23",23,"               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the "
"24",24,"               edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, "
"25",25,"               hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled "
"26",26,"               MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a "
"27",27,"               rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her..."
"28",28,"               Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts."

"30",30,"                         Freeze! FBI!"
"31",31,"               CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION"
"32",32,"               all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with "
"33",33,"               a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his "
"34",34,"               hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not "
"35",35,"               pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers..."
"36",36,"               THE SUSPECT'S HANDS"
"37",37,"               are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use "
"38",38,"               it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which "
"39",39,"               registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, "
"40",40,"               drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -"
"41",41,"               THE \""HOSTAGE\"""
"42",42,"               pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW "
"43",43,"               MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, "
"44",44,"               flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar "
"45",45,"               in these close quarters, but -"
"46",46,"               Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is "
"47",47,"               already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -"
"48",48,"               THE \""HOSTAGE\"""
"49",49,"               pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still "
"50",50,"               in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one "
"51",51,"               knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case "
"52",52,"               of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill "
"53",53,"               blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal "
"54",54,"               ACTION and SOUND are restored."
"55",55,"                                     BRIGHAM (O.S.)"
"56",56,"                         Okay, people, good exercise..."
"57",57,"               Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten."
"58",58,"               PULLING BACK"
"59",59,"               we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the \""hotel "
"60",60,"               room\"" and its \""corridor\"" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM "
"61",61,"               walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex-"
"62",62,"               Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says \""Firearms Instructor / "
"63",63,"               FBI Academy.\"""

"65",65,"                         Starling's reaction time was "
"66",66,"                         excellent. Let's break. Critique in "
"67",67,"                         five."
"68",68,"               A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, "
"69",69,"               begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. "
"70",70,"               Clarice nods amiably to the \""Suspect\"", then gives her "
"71",71,"               \""Hostage\"" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her "
"72",72,"               broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both "
"73",73,"               remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of "
"74",74,"               southern accent."
"75",75,"                                     ARDELIA"
"76",76,"                         Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?"

"78",78,"                              (indicating her gun)"

"82",82,"                         I love it when you talk dirty."
"83",83,"               As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's "
"84",84,"               little smile of pride. He frowns good-naturedly."
"85",85,"                                     BRIGHAM"
"86",86,"                         What're you laughin' at, Junior G-"
"87",87,"                         Man? She got off four rounds to your "
"88",88,"                         two."
"89",89,"               He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her "
"90",90,"               palm."
"91",91,"                                     BRIGHAM"

"93",93,"                         One hundred reps, each hand, every "
"94",94,"                         day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief "
"95",95,"                         wants to see you."
"96",96,"               He nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile "
"97",97,"               finally fading, looks out into the auditorium."
"98",98,"               SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD"
"99",99,"               sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He "
"100",100,"               is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through "
"101",101,"               the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one "
"102",102,"               arm."
"103",103,"               Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof "
"104",104,"               vest, follows her worried gaze."

"106",106,"                         What'd I do?"

"113",113,"               Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, "
"114",114,"               as Clarice joins him. He looks tired, haunted. Between master "
"115",115,"               and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality."

"124",124,"                         I hope so. They haven't posted "

"129",129,"                         interesting errand. Walk me to my "
"130",130,"                         car, Starling."
"131",131,"               They begin to cross the academy grounds. A group of trainees "
"132",132,"               jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach."

"139",139,"                         They have a compulsion to boast, "

"164",164,"               He walks on again, at a faster clip. She hurried to keep up."

"175",175,"                         If he won't talk, then I want straight "
"176",176,"                         reporting. How's he look, how's his "
"177",177,"                         cell look, what's he writing? The "
"178",178,"                         Director himself will see your report, "

"183",183,"               They're reached his car. His driver stamps on a cigarette, "
"184",184,"               climbs in behind the wheel. BURROUGHS, his assistant, says "
"185",185,"               something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door. "
"186",186,"               But Crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder. His "

"194",194,"                         Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. "
"195",195,"                         Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go "
"196",196,"                         over the physical procedures used "
"197",197,"                         with him. Do not deviate from them, "
"198",198,"                         for any reason. You tell him nothing "
"199",199,"                         personal, Starling. Believe me, you "
"200",200,"                         don't want Hannibal Lecter inside "
